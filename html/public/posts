Olga sat in bed (recovering) waiting the entire day for a response from our host, who was apparently too busy to respond to her questions.

In short, it involves interpreting cryptic statements in the Qu'ran to inspire one to apply external body-touching techniques, with the purported ability to heal pretty much any ailment that occurs to humans.  With a straight face, he said that all cancers, strokes, and any internal problem could be completely cured in minutes following his therapy. For instance, he shared one such attempt to heal a volunteer who was suffering from urinary pains (UTI, anyone?).

They mostly produce everything they need themselves, from food to materials to tools, having tough enough skin to live up here all year 'round without any of the comforts that we take for granted. Their lives are so simple yet so hard. The struggles they face are so remotely different than our pampered lives. They have to make due with very little and live as integrated with nature as possible. You can see the locals working hard all day long, planting, collecting, cooking and making their own tools from whatever materials they can find in nature.
