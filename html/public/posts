With our energy high after the bread, honey and jam at Elvira and Renzo\u2019s place we are up to a good start.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I did not mention yesterday that Renzo is a hardcore ultra marathoner, so he decided to do his morning bike stroll with us! He was our trusted guide for the first 15 km of the day and showed us around the nice countryside. We also got italian cappuccinos in Latisana.\n</p>\n<div class=\"img\">\n  <img class=\"square-image\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MrS1-9a5ScJsHBZnqCGBIpePHxHuzs9pROdTy_CJzJjZXLQuXYksc9LqgxqKBasjA345x6mEEniTjlsen_IU1wt5wOCgv1L3NsqmitllbzxmFEuENv54liwjg_oXzXKTY1Do6rTzwXg=w600\" />\n  <h3 class=\"location-text\">Morning stroll with Renzo</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img\">\n  <img class=\"square-image\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U8OPkJArDHZlksKP34GnNvNsnCoXHVLVbWcabZO7mMR_G2SXWVbnLdEzGxOtYvqzi-SxlPjrtx3bMkzNACOrU9UlTl4sO3hhG9HdDTVN7UwEYgaylg-BXQN0yoNHKo5uW0Ee6keYwuI=w600\" />\n  <h3 class=\"location-text\">Cappuccino break</h3>\n</div>\n<p>\n  After our goodbyes we biked a bit more for a pit stop in Marano Lagunare and then off to Palmanova. Palmanova was not initally part of the trip but Renzo spoke so highly of it we had to do the detour to see it. It was amazing! It is a city in the shape of a perfect nonagon (this means that it has nine corners if you look from the sky) and that shape is maintained throughout the city with a bunch of ring roads connecting it. It is really unique and, yes, they have tasty gelato that we could not skip on!\n</p>\n<div class=\"img\">\n  <img class=\"square-image\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fcBvzpXN1JoTDwA305528Lt14Uw9ZZIsrH6HL1Y4aR5dLJali50cNGNliUo0RhO0iBRgx01rlOb8dH8R1FtBzwFOoOhKBsESoimahBVPfgrr_LMtoA6DghlFpGZcg7a4wsDVdHTyqUE=w600\" />\n  <h3 class=\"location-text\">Palmanova Square (or Nonagon...)</h3>\n</div>\n<p>\n  We decided to spend the night in Aquileia. Aquileia is an old roman town with lots of ruins and places to visit. Our personal favorite was the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta. It is dated back to the 4th century and its architecture is really amazing. The most amazing characteristic is its mosaic floor, which is very well maintained and trully stunning. The mosaic contains such highlights as:\n  <ul>\n    <li>A tortoise (bad) battling a rooster (good).</li>\n    <li>A beefcake, clean-shaven Jesus, doing his best impression of Russell Crowe in Gladiator</li>\n    <li>Lochness Monster fishing</li>\n  </ul>\n</p>\n<div class=\"img\">\n  <img class=\"square-image\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kKWXBZNDkQflnv4X9TX6mIkpiacPP2L1Gv05fsMC-owx5pCTAZMJ2yRvJpK_1TmWoTzHuwd20qgW96KH4SmEHWrkNUYWkOfeSSvNQ3zPS9eUBujiqrxY1Jodm4I6CdEl5n0s5G1i4A4=w600\" />\n  <h3 class=\"location-text\">Check out beardless Jesus in the middle!</h3>\n</div>", "location": {"city": "Aquileia", "country": "Italy", "position": {"lat": 45.7681691, "lng": 13.3687199}}, "stars": 10, "timestamp": "2018-08-29T19:57:47.891185Z", "starred": false, "id": "5b86fabbf1099c0001fd825e"}, {"title": "Adriatic By Bike: Day 2", "photo": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JG5C1gOZtqgdHlMDh6DrNewBkl8UwG4Z44_V2synV4ahzVPJqVhRpVvwaCRoTmDnrpAiPn0XpnYhiDkDL2rjtBMnTLN17I-ia0LGvbOtJgM-e15MAFxWV619jYUlWTEfnRyDC2b6jps=w600", "safeUrl": "", "title": ""}, "structuredContent": {"nodes": [{"paragraph": {"text": "We decided to travel by bike so we need to be tough, right?

strategic location and wealth, Istanbul has served as the capital of numerous empires, notably the Byzantine Empire (330\u20131204 and 1261\u20131453) and the Ottoman Empire (1453\u20131922).\n</p>\n<div class=\"img\">\n\t<img class=\"square-image\"
