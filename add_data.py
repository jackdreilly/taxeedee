              <p>I am really excited to be writing our first post. We have been putting a lot of love into the website design that it is already a month in our trip and we have yet to make a post. But this is it! 
              <p>The main motivation behind the entire trip and the event that signified the official deadline 
              for us to have everything ready and packed to go was our friends Tala and Marwan's wedding in Beirut. 
              We have been talking about attending this event for months and it gave us momentum to continue on our journey.

                <h3 class="location-text">Bmekkine, Lebanon</h3></div>
              <p>Lebanon is a city with some insane amount of history. We visited Byblos, that is one of the oldest cities 
              in the world, as it has been continuously inhabited for the past 7,000 years! The city of Beirut was very 
              unique and the civil war it went through in the 70s-90s has definitely left an impact (you could actually see 
              the bullet holes on the sides of the buildings!). However, these days Beirut has been known as one of the 
              safest cities, so do not hesitate to visit! The architecture and vibe of the city was stunning.

                <h3 class="location-text">Byblos, Lebanon</h3></div>
              <p>There are so many different districts in the city that are massively different from each other ranging 
              from hipster areas (Mar Michael, Gemmayzeh), to the Armenian district and various Christian and Muslim oriented 
              areas throughout the city. This diversity played out in the nightlife as well where parties went all night long 
              from underground bomb selter clubs (thank you Wael for showing us a good time!) to fancy rooftop night clubs!

              <p>Lebanon in general has a Mediterranean and western vibe to it, and the food was absolutely delicious! Olga 
              could not get enough <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manakish'>Manouche</a> which can be eaten for 
              breakfast, lunch and dinner! Jack's favorite time of day was breakfast where there was a plethora of chickpeas 
              recipes, meats and yogurt. And of course we could not stay away from the unlimited supply of shawerma (probably 
              one in every corner)!
