South India: Munnar
Kerala
India

### paragraph 
After only lasting a day and a half in hecticness of Indian citylife in Fort Kochi, we changed pace and headed to Munnar, a remote "hill station" in the mountains, to enjoy some Indian nature.

### paragraph 
The trip up there was not an uneventful one of course... 

As our scheduled, direct bus broke down (delays are typical in India), we sought an alternative. 

Eventually, we found a man heading to Munnar as well. He had just returned from a holy pilgrimage to the town of Haridwar, where the Ganges river exits the Himalayan foothills. As a souvenir of his trip, he had taken home a Calistoga-bottle full of holy Ganges water, which was colored "ash-gray". He assured Olga that he had no intention of drinking it.

### paragraph

We adopted this man as our shepherd, and for the next 8 hours, we blindly followed him as he hopped on three separate buses, with each bus having no English indication of where we were going. Following him was no easy task, as we quickly would become separated after loading the ridiculously crowded bus: not in a BART sense kind of crowded but more like there isn't even space to squeeze a monkey in! Luckily, he never led astray, and the bus dropped us off within walking distance of our hostel.

Seriously no space left in the bus (and it's an 8 h drive...)

If there is space, some extra passengers will come in...

### paragraph
On the journey, we discovered that some buses in India are segregated, so women sit in the front and men in the back of the bus. We of course had no idea, so Jack got scolded a couple of times for sitting with me. Our approach now is to both sit (or stand...) next to each other in the back to avoid conflict.

### paragraph 
Despite the hectic journey, we were rewarded the next day with Munnar's magnificent landscapes and hiking paths.

Village houses

### paragraph 
Unfortunately, Munnar was hit hard by the recent floods in Kerala (August 2018) and the impact of the flood disaster left its marks everywhere. Many people were trapped in their homes due to landslides and fallen bridges, and some losing their lives. Our tour guide, Anand, told us that he and his family were isolated in his remote village home for two weeks, subsisting off of rationed food and limited water.

### paragraph

Amazingly, in order to reopen access for tourist season, it took a little under three weeks to clear all major landslides from roads (there must have been at least 50), construct temporary bridges, and clear all the debris. The resilience of Munnar and the Indian Government were on full display.

### paragraph

Itâ€™s beauty cannot be erased though and we were still lucky enough to get these amazing views of the mountains and the tea plantations!
