Volunteering at Heaven Hill Learning Academy
Gaunshahar
Nepal

### paragraph

We've found that a major benefit of travel is the freedom to seek experiences which require larger time-commitments, for instance, our week-long acro-yoga retreat, and the two-week Annapurna trek.

In addition to seeking self-growth opportunities, volunteering is also a perfect way to use your abundance of time!

Olga and I spent the last 15 days at a primary school in a remote, Nepalese mountain village, and have so many memorable and adorable moments to share.

<h3>Project</h3>

Using the volunteer/project pairing site, <a href="https//workaway.info">Workaway</a>, we sifted through a pile of potential projects, and chose a <a href="https://www.workaway.info/169379873767-en.html">truly worthwhile cause</a> led by a local school-teacher and principal, Shamser, whose ambition to change the nature of education in Nepal is summarized well in the video below:

While I could go on and on about the merits and ambitiousness of Shamser's battle against the outdated and abusive Nepali educational institution, I'll let the above resources and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heavenhillacademy/">Facebook Donation Page</a> suffice for background, and instead tell about our time on the mountain.

<h3>On the mountain</h3>

After a two-hour, steep-uphill trek from the closest bus stop, we arrive at the isolated, mountain town of Gaunshahar, home of Heaven Hill, the primary school Shamser built (literally) and founded.

Wikipedia quotes a population of 6000, but the community surrounding Heaven Hill is more like 200-300 recognizable faces and names.

Each morning we would find many of our neighboring friends out on their porches performing morning chores and chatting, always giving us a warm wave and "Namaste".

It's a completely foreign experience to both urban and rural America/Europe, where home-life is typically hidden behind walls and fences.

In contrast, Gaunshahar is truly a community, where children are raised by the village and front doors are left open.

### paragraph

Soon after arrival, we were warmly integrated into the community through some of our volunteering and extra-curricular activities.

<h3>Guitar Lessons</h3>

After spotting my guitar, one of the local high-school boys asked for guitar lessons, and I happily obliged, visiting him in his home (and meeting his tiny puppy, Tommy!). I subsequently met what seemed to be half of the Grade 8 boys, and was comforted to learn that Nepalese teenage boys are just as funny, obnoxious, and ambitious as I remember my childhood friends being.

<h3>Walking to School</h3>

Every morning, Olga and I would walk 45 minutes through the jungle to pick up a number of children from a nearby village. We instantly fell in love with the "four monkeys", who would hold our hand nearly the entire distance (freaking adorable). We'll always remember their requests to take their backpacks ("Me bag?"), and to eventually carry them on our shoulders once they tired ("Me carry?"). After arriving at the tiny, tiny village they called home, one of the mothers would welcome us with hot tea, and we'd converse in limited English, rehashing how beautiful their surrounding mountain landscapes were each evening.

<h3>Primitive Construction</h3>

We were tasked with building a storage shed for the Heaven Hill school (finally finding a use for my structural engineering degree). Starting with a small plot bearing 9 uneven, off-kilter bamboo columns, we managed to produce a worthy structure: enclosed, waterproof, and sturdily held together with scraps of wood splints and ethernet cable. Although, just to be safe, we did recommend that people not breathe too strongly when in its proximity...

I also had the opportunity to live true jungle life, by climbing barefoot into trees and hacking down some branches as a base layer for a yak's stable. My favorite part was carrying the bundled harvest on my back using the traditional "Nepali headband".

The daily Nepali hustle

### paragraph

<h3>Dal Bhat Power at the "Round House"</h3>

Each evening, after safely returning the four monkeys and trudging through the jungle in the dark, we would return to Shamser's modest home for dinner. We'd help chop vegetables, and reminisce about the memorable moments at school, waiting for the warm, hearty meal. While "Dal Bhat", the traditional Nepali meal of rice, dal and curry (supposedly enjoyed daily by over 90% of Nepalis), should surely not be missed on a Nepal visit, we got the full experience by eating dal bhat twice a day for 15 days straight! I think Olga would tire even of spaghetti at such a frequency.

The "Round House"

### paragraph

Nevertheless, we survived, and eventually came to appreciate the differences in each dal bhat preparations, relishing the nuances of pickle flavoring and cauliflower textures. To maintain some dietary sanity, we would supplement our meals with a side of digestive cookies, and longingly look forward to our once-a-week, two-hour voyage for veggie burgers in the nearest town.

### paragraph

One of the highlights of our trip was our shared experiences with the dozen-or-so other volunteers on the project. Particularly, we formed very close bonds with a crew of 8 of us who arrived at the roughly same time, and all shared a lodging in a cozy circular hut (nicknamed the "Round House") containing primitive beds and even more-primitive sanitation...

Throughout the two weeks, we were treated to a rat infestation, resulting in midnight squealing, endless scampering, and three separate instances of seemingly suicidal rats plunging from the rafters onto the sleeping bags of snoozing volunteers.

Movie night in the "Round House"

### paragraph

This led to one memorable exchange. After the second particular instance of rat kamikaze caused our friend, Griet, to squeal in the middle of the night, her boyfriend, Niels, reservedly announced that he had been targeted the night before by a similarly malicious mouse, but had opted to keep it a secret to save Griet from the harsh reality that she was sleeping on top a rat landing pad.

### paragraph

My own breaking point was reached when the rats threw a 3 AM dance party on our last evening of sleep, and as I lay awake considering calling in a noise complaint, they concluded the affair by urinating on my head. To be fair, I'm fairly certain a number of parties from my college days followed a similar script...

<h3>Teaching time at Heaven Hill</h3>

Aside from all the good times above, we did squeeze in 6 hours a day of teaching at Heaven Hill. We were responsible for many different activities, including leading Computer Lab, teaching English, Science and Math, and taking some of the special-needs children outside for some special one-on-one time, playing soccer and other social activities with them.

Olga and I had particular fun coming up with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5srAifaSH1Ggp1mKJbVuUC9k4KeBnmzOf2LQkTjA_M/edit">Computer Lab ideas</a>. The existing curriculum for computers was exceedingly mind-numbing, including such joys as memorizing the definition of RAM, ROM (and other arcane technological terms), and typing out sentences.

Computer Lab class

### paragraph

To show the kids that computers are fun, powerful, and empowering, we introduced them to Google Maps, taking virtual field trips to the Egyptian Pyramids, downtown Manhattan, and the Eiffel Tower (the French volunteer twins, Claire and Cecille, supplemented this particular lesson with a little fib to the kids that they were born atop the Eiffel Tower).

### paragraph

We also had the 4th graders give slide-show presentations (of course using Google Slides, I'm such a fanboy...) on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OkOxELcPw6I4FaO0Sw20OmfL_i4vTgT_dh5FMdeLtq4/edit">their favorite animals</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16UTk6HZ2CFMg37EHpC2KVcdVhWZRsHqXNwywFm2jHM8/edit?usp=sharing">favorite countries</a>, my favorite line being: "Cortes wanted the money of Mexico so he killed the Aztec Emperor and he took the gold".

Watching the 4th graders (there are only two of them!) beam with pride and confidence as they stood in front of the volunteers to deliver their slides was a particularly emotional moment for Olga and I.

### paragraph

Watching other volunteers find innovative ways to keep the kids entertained and engaged (and trying myself!) reminded myself how difficult teaching is and how important it is. Throughout our travels, we've witnessed many times the difference between an educated person and an uneducated one (or an un/educated society, for that matter), and have discerned a strong correlation with education and compassion, consideration and ambition. Going to work every day was exceedingly rewarding, even if we influenced just a single student that day. The effort of Shamser and the other passionate teachers in Gaunshahar will certainly revolutionize the community, and, through arming a whole new generation with superior skills, set the entire area on a more prosperous path.

Thank you, Shamser, for giving us the experience of a lifetime. You showed us how living a dedicated, focused, and simple life can change the lives of many for the better. The volunteering system in Gaunshahar should serve as a blueprint for how travelers can make immediate and lasting impact on grassroots efforts anywhere in the world by simply creating space for creativity and personality.

This was our first volunteer experience of any serious length of time, but we are already planning our next opportunity in Thailand, where we head to tomorrow...
