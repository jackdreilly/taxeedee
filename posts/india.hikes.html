Tea, Factories, and Leeches, Oh My! Hiking in Munnar
Munnar
India

### paragraph

My prior life experience with leeches had been limited to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThrUH4vs7Kc">that scene in "Lean on Me"</a>, with these giant, slug-shaped creatures attaching themselves onto the boys while crossing a mud pit. It was then a surprise when, only 30 minutes into our rain-soaked day-hike in the Munnar tea gardens, our local guide pulled a black, rice-sized speck off his sock, and plainly said, "leech", as he flicked the speck off into the bushes.

### paragraph

The "leech" comment didn't initially cause us any stir, as his frankness and laconic coolness made us feel as though this was a one-time occurrence, and there was nothing to be concerned about such a tiny pest.

As it was, we were just getting into the groove of what promised to be a great day hike. Starting at dawn, there was a slight mist, keeping the temperatures low and enjoyable. The tea gardens were a remarkable sight; the regularity of their shapes and pristine upkeeping gave the illusion that the entire hillside was woven together as a quilt of lush, green leaves.

### paragraph

All the while, our local guide, Anand, was informing us of life in the tea fields. His mother and father were both tea pickers their entire lives, an arduous profession, he assured us. The tea plantations are owned by mega-corporation, Tata, which provide a daily payment of a mere 300 rupees (less than $4) a day for 26kg of manually picked tea leaves. Many of the younger generations in Munnar, including Anand, seek a better life within the burgeoning tourism industry by leading tours, driving rickshaw taxis and hustling the streets for any sort tourism work.

Local guide, Anand

### paragraph

Our complete ignorance of tea production (after all, we're coffee drinkers) made for more opportunities to learn from Anand. He described that black, green, and white tea leaves were all present on each tea branch (and all colored green), with the white tea being the smallest leaves nearest the top of the branch, green leaves being slightly bigger and further down from the white, and the black comprising the remaining. The different leaves are separated in the picking process, with black leaves dominating the gross weight of the harvest, thus explaining the relative costs of the different varieties.

### paragraph

You, the reader: "Cool tea story, but I came here for the leeches!".
Roger that, loud and clear. 

As the tea lessons lessened in frequency, the precipitation picked up in its stead. And with the precipitation, came more frequent picking at the socks and boots by Anand. 

Soon, he pulled off another leech, and then another. 

Then, it dawned on us that Anand was no more a delicious, blood-filled bag of nutrients than we were. 
Olga, letting out a mild screech, was the next lucky winner of a tiny leech attaching to her hiking boots. 

After I plucked off the bugger (way harder than it looks, given their wriggliness and wetness: think lubricated inch worm), we were treated to the vulgar, ungodly "Dance of the Leech":

### paragraph

Imagine having your arms chopped off, your legs sewed together, and then having your mode of locomotion being an alternation between balancing on your feet, and then balancing on your head, back to feet, to head, and so on, like a demented version of the gymnast's backspring.

Welcome to the daily commute of the leech. Any creationist arguments rooted in the divinely-designed beauty of Earth's creatures are easily refuted upon a single glimpse of the leech's walk.

Gag.

### paragraph

Things escalated from there.

The light rain had transitioned into a proper pour, and given the leech's affinity to wet weather, shoe checks were instituted as a mandatory measure at every bush clearing we reached, averaging 2 or 3 wrigglers per hiker per check.

Identification was not as simple as it may seem, as they were indistinguishable from tiny wet leaves already stuck to our shoes. In my (Jack) case, I had chosen my trusty Chaco sandals for the day, and had the joy of searching my bare skin, and praying they hadn't made their way down to my soles.

Shoe check time!

### paragraph

Mostly, the leeches posed a disgusting nuisance. But occasionally, if unspotted for a few minutes, they would attach themselves by their mouth, and begin to drain us dry. They would instantly increase in size by ten fold from the volume of ingested body juice. Upon discovery and removal of a "sucker", a good amount of blood would pour from the bite site, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudin">anticoagulant agents introduced by the leech</a>.

### paragraph

I had a couple of winners on the tops of my feet, which led to mild bleeding and mild irritation, but not much else. Anand, pulling from the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda">Ayurvedic medicine</a> playbook, assured us that there was no concern, as leeches only drink unpure blood. Other nuggets of medical advice proferred from locals included:

<ul>
  <li>Applying cigarette smoke to the wounded area for purification, </li>
  <li>Avoiding application of smoke in favor of tumeric powder,</li>
  <li>Eating porcupine to reduce childbirth pain,</li>
</ul>

and finally, my favorite dialogue of the day... After spotting some monkeys on the side of the hiking trail, Anand assured us that they weren't dangerous, and were, in fact, of great medicinal value. Olga, now engaged in the conversation, asked a series of questions to ascertain how the monkey was indeed useful: do you need to touch the monkey? use its hair? milk? nails?  A confused Anand responded in the negative to each of the questions, in effect implicitly answering in the affirmative the unspoken question of whether the whole monkey itself was ingested.

### paragraph

So it was, three weary hikers, trudging in the wet tea fields, tracking one's own leech count, when we should have stopped for lunch on the mountain top. Anand looked at us, and motioned to the dark sky, then to our feet, indicating that it may be best to descend and call it a day for hiking. We agreed, and quickly made our way down the hill, with the only remarkable event being a snake crossing immediately in front of Anand.

Happy, wet campers

### paragraph

When we reached the rode, the sun broke through on cue. We basked for a bit, and settled down inside an empty hostel under renovation for a traditional, home-made South Indian meal of dosa and chutney, served on banana leaves.

### paragraph

To finish off the day, we headed to a local tea factory, where we learned about the surprisingly simple process of tea processing. We moved from the sorting bins to the grinder, then the drier, all running on rattling, old machinery that would not be out of place in a Charlie Chaplin film. The only "technology" we spotted was a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-Efficiency-Tea-Color-Sorter-Tea_60704241933.html?s=p">computerized, optical sorting machine</a>, which separates tea by color at a rate of up to 1200 times a second! Sounds like a fun arduino project...

### paragraph

We will finish this post with a fitting coda to this day. As we finished our lunch, and felt infinitely better about the day's remainder, Olga reached to scratch her back, and came up with a fingerprints of blood, then immediately shot a panicking glance over to me. Saving our readers from the graphic photographic evidence, we can simply share that the leech attached to Olga's back had well over an hour to savor its meal, reaching a size on par with the "Stand By Me" leeches at the story's begin. I guess Hollywood isn't always exaggeration!
