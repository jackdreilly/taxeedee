NZ roadtrip - Backpacking
Catlins Forest --> Fiordlands
New Zealand

### paragraph
A few days in the trip already, we have mostly gotten used to the new norm of "van life" and are growing to be big fans of it. The simplicity of the life presents a good opportunity to describe the pattern of "zen" that we began to cement in our daily routine with "Vinnie the van". The mornings invariably begin with me waking up thirty minutes before dawn. The thin sleeping mats that come standard in the rental van provide just enough support to avoid permanent injury, but not enough to avoid feeling like your lungs were steamrolled, with shooting, yet ephemeral pains making their way thorugh your back. Waiting until I've decompressed a bit, I kill a bit of time reading, then set up the portable table outside to get going with the joe. Some stretching and more reading, I've had enough waiting for Olga to wake up and start making enough rattling and rummaging inside Vinnie to give Olga no other choice but to join me. Breakfast follows quickly after, after which we head out for our daily activity (i.e., hike). A nice finishing time usually arrives around 5, after which we proceed to some balance between the cheapest, closest, and most-appealing campground to set up for the night. Dinner is enjoyed either inside Vinnie or, if the weather and sandflies permit, we eat outside. The best part of the day follows, where we set up the cushions to convert Vinnie into our bed, and lock ourselves in for good somewhere around 8 to 9:30 PM. Usually we're out of cell range, which enables distraction-free reading. Then we recap our great day outdoors and get an awesome 9-11 hours rest to repeat it all again! The simplicity of the day is key to its effectiveness and joyfulness. As we never want to get too comfortable in the situation we are in we decided to change a bit of pace, leave "Vinnie" at the parking lot for a few days and go on a 3-day backpacking adventure in the Fiordlands!

<h3>Day 5: Catlins Forest</h3>
The Catlins are remarkable for their wetness, I suppose technically a rain forest. The trees were dripping with moisture, and we noticed some thicker bush more reminsicent of Asia than our NZ experience to date. The trail was pretty much empty, and we enjoyed two waterfalls to ourselves. Not a bad way to spend the day...

Views from the road

### paragraph
In the afternoon, we made our way up to the start of the Kepler Hike at Lake Te Anau. On the way, we felt as close to homeless as we have so far when we were handed tokens to take a hot shower in a bus station. The manager was thrilled to have humans to speak with, and enthusiastically described the most efficient way to deposit the tokens ("after derobing!") and even gave us a bonus token. Nevertheless, we were appreciative and clean to start our way towards the lake.

### paragraph
We learned that the only cheap option to camp in the region was "Andy's Car Park" for $13NZ/person/night. Andy was a real treat, a 60-something lifer of NZ. He told us what to expect on our hike, and reminded us of the "sand flies", which would "keep us itching for months..." (or weeks more realstically). "You'll find them in your socks, eating away at your feet." Five days later, we are still itching from the little sons-a-bitches, who could be compared to more nagging, more numerous mosquitos, yet slightly easier to kill. The bites are very satisfying to pick, as they're smaller and less messy than mosquito bites, yet just as itchy. More later...

<h3>Day 6: Fiordlands, Kepler Trek</h3>
We started our hike from Rainbow Reach, and proceeded towards the first tenting location, about 4.5 hours away. We had great river views most of the way, very reminiscent of the American, yet much wider at times. We had lunch at the "Control Gates" for the dam, and an hour or so later were setting up our tent. Thirty minutes after we plopped down on the beach abutting the campsite, we felt the first sand-fly bite. Then the next. Then the next... Pretty soon we were scrambling towards the tent, frantically zipping ourselves in. For the remainder of our time, we were fully covered with sweatshirts and pants, even in the warm weather, to protect ourselves. We cooked our backpacker meal of Uncle Ben's fried rice, and I consoled my still-empty stomach with peanut butter and trail mix, which was enough to push me over the edge. We retired to the tent, where I suffered through a restless night, and aching shoulder from the paper-thin $3NZ sleeping pad.

<h3>Day 7: Fiordlands, Kepler Trek</h3>
We left the flats of the river-walk behind and ascended up Mt. Luxmore, with an elevation gain of 1300 meters. The views on the top were amazing, particularly when we hit 2-hour-long ridge-walk. With not so much rest, we completed the hike in 8 hours, the most tired we were to be all trip. We had seconds to set up our tent before being torn apart by the sandflies, and then simultaneously dove through the narrow zipper opening of our $20 Warehouse (think Walmart) tent. In a fever-dream state, we devoured half a giant Kit Kat, and passed out for an hour nap. Feeling more social after the rest, we chatted up a nice Dutch couple, who were planning their subsequent trip to Nepal, and we were more than happy to share our experiences with them and pitching the volunteering job we did with Shamser.

Ridge walk

### paragraph
Once the Dutch disappeared to their tents, a French couple, Marie and Elliot, took their spots, and we continued with the gab. We jibed incredibly well with this 23-year-old couple, as we shared our respective experiences of travel and our passions back home. They happened to be academics in Philosophy of Science (a la Kuhn, Popper), and it was refreshing to talk shop with someone about a topic other than travel. We met again in the morning, and upon noticing them rationing individual nuts in their trail mix, offered up some of our "Cookie Time" snacks, for which they were very appreciative. We exchanged numbers, and even had the pleasure of rendez-vous'ing in Franz Josef Glacier roughly a week later. For some reason, we've repeatedly vibed well with French couples on our trip (sorry every other couple we've met! We love you too!), and very much hope to spend more time in France visiting old friends and making new ones in the future.

<h3>Day 8: Fiordlands, Kepler Trek</h3>
It was another plodding day to finish up the trek, as we worked our way through the valley to the river with a sustained flatness in the path. We met a very pleasant older Kiwi couple from Wellington named Mary and Peter (I couldn't resist asking where was Paul), who invited us over for a bike ride once we found ourselves settled in Wellington. Other than that, we had a contest to see how many tree placards would pass before reaching our car (Olga barely won), and then had a warm embrace with Vinnie the Van. For our first non-van dinner of the trip, we had lasagna, a burger, and some fries. The post-tramp meal is quite possibly the best part of the entire tramping experience, given how well-earned the meal is. We drove onwards towards Milford Sound, and found a nice stopping point at a cheap camping in an open meadow abutting the Fiord mountain range. Sleep was good.
