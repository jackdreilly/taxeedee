Manta Rays in Bali
Nusa Penida
Indonesia

### paragraph
More mermaid stories, but we could not resist! We heard about this magical place in Nusa Penida where you can go and experience amazing diving and potentially see Manta Rays. We jumped at the opportunity to show off our freshly awarded divers certificates. We love the diving experience so much that we were mostly eager to put on our tanks and be underwater and did not really research what the fuss about Manta Rays actually was...

Once underwater, my first struggle was to fix my mask, as I had used way too much soap as an anti-fog agent and my eyes could not handle it. I started playing with my mask (taking it on and off to make the soap bareable) and was not really paying attention what was going on around me. A second later, now with my mask on, I catch a shadow right next to me, getting larger and larger with every second. I turn around and have a mini heart attack as this 4 m long "thing" is coming directly for me. Without losing face (while I was mildly panicing), and playing it cool, I swam and hid behind Jack, my faithful underwater savior
