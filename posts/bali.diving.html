Manta Rays in Bali
Nusa Penida
Indonesia

### paragraph
More mermaid stories, but we could not resist! We heard about this magical place in Nusa Penida where you can go and experience amazing diving and potentially see Manta Rays. We jumped at the opportunity to show off our freshly awarded divers certificates. We love diving so much that we were mostly eager to put on our tanks and be underwater and did not really research what the fuss about the Manta Rays actually was...

### paragraph
Once underwater, my first struggle was to fix my mask, as I had used way too much soap, as an anti-fog agent, and my eyes could not handle it. I started playing with my mask (taking it on and off to make the soap bareable) and was not really paying attention what was going on around me. A second later, now with my mask on, I catch a shadow right next to me, getting larger and larger every second. I turn around and have a mini heart attack as this 4 m long "thing" is coming directly at me. Without losing face and playing it cool (I was mildly panicing in the inside), I swam and hid behind Jack, my faithful underwater savior, while trying to get his attention and pointing at the "thing"... Apparently, the Manta Rays we were supposed to see, are these gigantic underwater creatures that are on average 3-6 m in diameter! I think Jack and I were expecting them to be maybe a foot long so our surprise and amazement was enormous!

Look at that friendly giant!

### paragraph
A few minutes later and after spotting a couple more Manta Rays, all in very close proximity underwater, I slowly started to get my courage back and sheepishly started to swim on my own. The Manta Rays are actually very sweet and curious with human divers. They were mostly minding their own business but when they saw a diver they would approach to take a look of what that new bubble-blowing fish was. There were so many of them! We didn't really have to do much, just sit there and every few minutes a new Manta Ray would swim by, stop, stare deep into our eyes and slowly swim away! It was such an amazing and experience and the Manta Rays were so beautiful to watch. They were so calm and graceful swimmers and mostly resembling friendly underwater cows, grazing slowly at the plankton all around us.

Come closer buddy!

### paragraph
While we were super stoked with all the Manta Rays around, the experience did not end there! We also found 3 lovely turtles swimming around the reef. We could not have asked for a more successful dive!

Swimming with the fishes

### paragraph
In short, we had an amazing time diving in Bali. We made so many underwater friends and swimming with the Manta rays was definitely a moment that we will never forget. Off for new adventures soon!
