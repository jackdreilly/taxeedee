Adriatic By Bike: Little Brown Signs
Venice
Italy
<p>
  Our first day on road, and we picked up on the most important skill: more than endurance, aerodynamics and nutrition combined, it is sign-spotting that is the most valuable skill for navigating Italy's bike paths. 
  The different regions of Italy have relatively-well signed routes with simple names (e.g., I1, I3 in Veneto).
  But these signs are not relatively-well sized...

  They are a smidge bigger than a t-shirt tag, and don't particularly stand out well with the uniform color of "background-brown" that they decided to use.  
  It didn't take us long to develop a knack for spotting (and occasionally missing) these navigational postage stamps.
  And as soon as we become adequately skilled, we then learned that they are quite likely to be either both missing and just-plain-wrong, with a precision of 70% and a recall of 50% on a good path.
  We were set back 30 minutes due to a sign that pointed due-west, which ended up meaning "Head due-south", with something maybe lost in translation along the way.

    <h3 class="location-text">Approximations of the truth...</h3>
  </div>
<p>
  In the end, we have settled upon a pretty successful routine of:
  <ol>
    <li>checking the route on BikeMaps for the stretch ahead,</li>
    <li>using the route marking, but with a heaping spoonful of scepticism,</li>
    <li>and checking the route again on BikeMaps, just to be sure.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Now that we've got our navigational bearings, we can sit back and enjoy the beautiful Italian country-side! Until next time...

  Wait, are those rainclouds up ahead???
