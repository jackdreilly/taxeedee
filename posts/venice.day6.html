Adriatic By Bike: Day 6
Rosandra
Italy

### paragraph

  With full bellies, rested legs and a touch of sadness at leaving beautiful Trieste, we were ready to cross over to Slovenia.
  But first, we enjoyed a morning coffee with our Airbnb host, Nicola.
  Of note, he described the social importance in Italy of not just sharing an espresso with a friend, but doing so with haste, as there were upwards of TEN coffees to be enjoyed in a day (as he was a restaurant manager, he started each day with a standing coffee appointment with the chef, followed by one with the host, followed by…).
  While this jibed well with Jack's “Jo n’ jam” approach to caffeine, it was downright offensive to Olga's Greek sensibility.  She typically stretches the enjoyment of a “freddo cappuccino” to just short of milk fermentation.

1 down, 9 to go...

### paragraph

  Once we were on the road, we immediately entered on a gravel bike path that led straight uphill to the nature reserve, Val Rosandra. As the path was converted from an old rail line, it offered many tunnels, bridge passes (DYK all bridges were at one time or another, a rail bridge, or so I have been told!) and a perfectly steady inclination to our destination.

Tunneling through Giordano Cottur Trail

### paragraph

  Rosandra provided us a small natural respite from our city touring. We mucked around in some caves, crossed an apparently vestigial river-bed, and hiked up some skree to an old church. While the church was locked, it did provide a nice setting for a yoga photo opp. It also bared a striking resemblance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg3BYU2U6ic">Slash's guitar solo church in the November Rain video</a>.

### paragraph

  After our 500m altitude gain, ending in the Italian/Slovenian border crossing, we were treated to an amazing descent through the Slovenian countryside. Vinyards, cottages, rivers, and churches were ever present and twice as enjoyable when on a decline. We eventually met up with the beautiful Parenzana bike path (again, another converted rail line).

### paragraph

We made a pit stop at a biker Burger bar (our midtrip feeding frenzies we have started to liken to filling our gas tanks), and noticed two things:
<ol>
  <li>Slovenians have mastered the burger</li>
  <li>Slovenians are distinct from Italians in both language and appearance, despite being kilometers within one another, and no border control to speak of. Yet another opportunity to learn some new foreign words!</li>
</ol>

Slovenian Burger Time

### paragraph

Despite our adequate caloric levels, we did not quite have the panache to make it all the way to our intended stop of Piran, and settled an hour short in the equally cozy town of Izola in the Istrian coast. After pitching our tent in record time, we spent a brief evening in the Izola city center, stumbling upon some beautiful live folk music performance, and grabbing our requisite gelato du jour.

### paragraph

Jack will remember this day for the amazing biking and good exercise, and Olga will remember with just a pinch of PTSD over the Rosandra ascent.
