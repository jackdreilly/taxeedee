Dogs of Annapurna: The Adventures of Silly Milly
Upper Pisang
Nepal

### paragraph
Welcome to a new subseries of Taxeedee: "Dogs of Annapurna", where we dive deep into the relatively unexamined world of canines along the Annapurna trekking circuit in Nepal.

Despite the fact that no guidebooks pay any attention to these furry trail-mascots, the circuit is positively overrun with dogs of many shapes, colors, and hygiene levels.

We point our first spotlight on a delightful tale of friendship and reunion between our beloved travelers and their new friend, "Silly Milly".

### paragraph

One evening, a few days into the two-week traversal of the circuit, we arrived at our tea-house for the night after a long day's walking. Welcoming us at our stop was a diminuitive white-and-black pup of unknown origin or family. As she (or he, we never figured out) was the first pooch who wasn't, at the surface, flea-bitten, we immediately took a liking to her. We gave her the name "Milly", while subsequently attaching the prefix "Silly" to complete her christening.

Silly Milly at her tea-house

### paragraph

After a spot of rest, Olga and I made a small venture to the local Buddhist temple, only to discover that we were a threesome as Milly had invited herself along for the walk! The newly-formed trio trudged onward, passing an array of points-of-interest, including some charming Buddhist prayer wheels.

The whimsical nature of our journey was not to last long, as trouble lurked behind the bend in the road; street dogs!

Upper Pisang Riff Raff!

### paragraph
It was clear that Milly was not chummy with the other Upper Pisang trail-pups, and after a tense stand-off, a pack of canine juvenile delinquents were in hot pursuit of our beloved Silly Milly. Darting down narrow alleys and through straw-hut domiciles, Milly evaded her pursuants with equal parts deftness and swiftness. For a moment, the scurrying noises subsided and all was quiet. We lost track of her, and could only pray for a peaceful resolution. Five minutes down the trail, we were delighted to look upon a ledge and find our precious Milly in hiding!

Come save me Olga!

### paragraph

Olga plucked the pup from her hide-out and carried her the rest of the way, much to the chagrin of the bested street dogs.

Thanks for the lift, pal!

Once in safe hands, we finished our journey to the Buddhist temple and took in the magnificent views and striking architecture with our Milly in tow.

The End...

### paragraph

<b>Coda:</b> Well, at least we thought this the end! The following morning, we bid our new four-legged friend farewell, and started again on our circuit.  We reminisced often about our times with Silly Milly, and assumed she would only visit us in our memories. Imagine our surprise when 5 days and 60km later, we spotted a white-and-black pup at the top of the 4900m Tilicho Lake acting suspiciously silly-like and suspiciously Milly-like... It was a our dear friend! She had no doubt been on the same trail, and the same pace as us for nearly a week, a mountain dog in the truest. This would certainly explain her unfamiliarity with the locals of Upper Pisang; she was a foreign traveler just like us!

And thus, we truly conclude our remarkable story of Silly Milly: one part street-dog, two parts adventurer, with a hearty dash of silly. Hike on you crazy diamond!
