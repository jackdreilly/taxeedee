South India: Fort Koshi and Munnar
Kerala
India

### paragraph 
We finally landed in India! After talking about it for so long, it’s time to see what it is actually all about!

### paragraph 
Our first stop was Fort Koshi in Kerala (a state in the south west of India). This area is known for its tea plantations and the numerous canals in the backwaters. After a long good night’s sleep to get rid of the jet-lag, we decided to take a trip to see the backwaters. We got on a small non-motorized boat for the tour. The boat was navigated by one person in the front that was using a big bamboo stick to push against the bottom of the canal to propel the boat. There was another person in the back with a big bamboo stick as well but he was mostly using it to steer the boat. The waters were very calm and not very deep and we got some amazing views around the canals.

Great views all around

### paragraph 
Right before lunch (rice with a variety of curries served on a banana leaf), our guide took us to a remote village and demonstrated the rope-making process using the coconut fibers. Jack was selected to test the durability of the final product!

### paragraph 
While in Fort Koshi we also went to see a Kathakali performance. Kathakali is a traditional Indian form of dance, which is characterized by the elaborate costumes, makeup and face-masks that the actors wear. It is a story-telling performance in which actors only use their facial expressions and body language to communicate their role. They are accompanied by handheld drums and singing. It was mesmerizing to watch!

### paragraph 
After a couple of days in Fort Koshi we decided we needed a break and decided to visit Munnar, a remote town in the mountains, to enjoy some of the Indian nature.

### paragraph 
The trip up there was not an uneventful one of course... The direct bus we were supposed to take unfortunately broke down, so not knowing what to do we started asking around the bus station and found someone who was also heading our direction. His English was mediocre so our communication could only convey very little information. We blindly followed him on to a bus that we had no idea which direction it was going and essentially kept track of him and waited to see when we would get off the bus (not creepily at all) to follow along. This was not an easy endeavor as all the buses in India are ridiculously crowded. Not in a BART sense kind of crowded but more like when the bus is about to depart from the station there is not even a possibility for a monkey to squeeze in! So even keeping track of our “guide” was challenging. This system worked quite well and after 3 buses we finally reached our destination!

Seriously no space left in the bus (and it's a 5 h drive...)

If there is space, some extra passengers will come in...

### paragraph 
Some buses in India are segregated, so women sit in the front and men in the back of the bus. We of course had no idea, so Jack got scolded a couple of times for standing on the wrong side of the bus without us realizing what was going on!

### paragraph 
Munnar, is a remote city up in the mountains in Kerala (a state in the south-west of India). We decided to visit, to experience first hand the beauty of India’s nature and were not disappointed!

### paragraph 
Unfortunately, Munnar was hit hard by the recent floods in Kerala (August 2018) and the impact of the flood disaster left its marks everywhere. The local people have tried really hard to rebuilt the roads that were carried away, the bridges that were swept away and clear the area from all the trash and debris that comes along with the flood.

It’s beauty cannot be erased though and we were still lucky enough to get these amazing views of the mountains and the tea plantations!
