Adriatic By Bike: Day -1
Venice
Italy

### paragraph
	The first day of our 500km, 13 day bicycle tour of the Adriatic, and we progressed <i>negative 15km</i> towards our goal! At this rate, we'll be in Iceland by Labor Day, just a bit off our intended target of Croatia...

<h3>To explain the above...</h3>

### paragraph

Friday morning, we packed up our life into a single backpack (each! we don't share <b>everything</b>...), with Jack's $30 Turkguitar and Garth Brooks cowboy hat getting the green light, and Olga's "<i>hair</i>-senal" getting the red light, under the agreement that
<ol>
	<li>Jack would continue to love Olga, frizz and all, and</li>
	<li>Olga would get a Tim McGraw-calibur country love song written for her during the trip.</li>
</ol>

Athens Airport, Greece

### paragraph

	While there were certainly at least <i>trace</i> levels of planning prior to arrival, we hadn't quite firmed up some of the larger details:
	<ul>
		<li>how we would transport our backpacks on the bikes,</li>
		<li>where we would obtain panniers (bike bags),</li>
		<li>how our butts would be adequately padded for the dozens of saddle-hours ahead,</li>
		<li>where we would sleep our first night,</li>
		<li>you get the idea....</li>
	</ul>

### paragraph

	Though we aren't quite at the "actively practicing" levels of religion these days, we were starting to consider divine intervention as one of the more realistic solutions to our hefty list of known unknowns (to say nothing of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk">unknown unknowns!</a>) 

<h3>The gods answered our call,</h3>

### paragraph

... and their names were <a href="http://www.dimoranaviglio.it/en/contact-us/">Gianluca and Monica</a>, the owners of the <a href="http://www.travelandbike.it/wp/en/">bicycle rental shop</a> that we used for our trip. Let's replay an audio transcription of our initial meeting....

<ul>
	<li><i>Gianluca</i>: I see you have backpacks, will those fit on the bikes?</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: Uhhh, I think maybe they'll, umm....</li>
	<li><i>Gianluca</i>: No problem, you can store the bags with us and we can bring them to you upon your return</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: Oh gee, that's great, thanks for uh....</li>
	<li><i>Gianluca:</i>And, I'm assuming that you have panniers</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: No thanks, I'm not hungry</li>	
	<li><i>Gianluca:</i>Allora....We rent panniers for a very reasonable price, we can do 2-for-1, you should be able to fit all your things comfortably</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: Oh pan<b>NIERS</b>, yeah, those would be sweet</li>
	<li><i>Gianluca</i>: No problemo. As well, seeing as though it's raining, and you have no waterproof gear, we also have a B&B, that we'd be able to provide to you tonight at a discount rate.</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: We'll see if that fits in budget...[[pensive, if not slightly constipated look to feign bargaining skills]]]</li>
	<li><i>Gianluca</i>: While you think, I can mention that we'll be driving by the sporting goods store, if there's say, any....butt pads... you need to purchase?</li>
	<li><i>Jack</i>: You are our savior</li>
</ul>

Gianluca and Monica's B&B

### paragraph

	After a quick (free) shuttle to their splendid B&B, we have arrived back at the beginning of the post; while our trip should have started from Mestre, we stayed our first night 15km west of Mestre, in Dolo.

### paragraph

	To avoid making it an utterly farcical first day of a cyclying tour, we did manage to hop on our bikes at night and explore the small and enchanting town of Dolo to enjoy some authentically Italian pizza (Jack's first!).

Dolo, Italy

### paragraph

	We'll certainly look back on this time as a welcome calm before the storm of miles ahead of us. Next up, Jesolo, Italy in 65km...
