Diving in Thailand
Koh Tao
Thailand

### paragraph
Whoever knows me even a little bit, can verify the fact that I am part fish. I don't know how I have waited so long for this experience but with Jacko by my side, I can finally say that I am officially a mermaid now! One of the most amazing experiences we have had in Thailand so far was to go scuba diving! We did our Open Water and Advanced Diver certification in a small island off the coast of Thailand, Koh Tao.

### paragraph
After doing a good bit of research on where the best place to go scuba diving is, we landed on the <a href='https://www.saireecottagediving.com/'>Sairee Cottage Diving</a> in Koh Tao. We mainly selected it as it came highly reviewed and recommended by previous divers and it had a neat accomodation package. Sairee Cottage draws enthusiastic and interesting clients, which enhanced our overall experience by sharing our time with our awesome group and amazing instructors (James and Katie)!

Celebrating a successful first ocean dive!

### paragraph
For the time we stayed there, we were treated to really nice and cozy bungalow accomodation right at the beach. Oh yes, huge upgrade from our previous lifestyle choices. If you have been following our adventures, you know what I mean... It was a pleasure to spend a few days in luxury. We got a pool to play in and, of course, perform our basic scuba skills in (yes, we did go in there wearing full blown scuba gear and look like dorks but fortunately there is no photo evidence to prove it and haunt us).

Regulator in and giant stride entry!

### paragraph
I seriously loved every part of the experience! Including:
<ul>
    <li>the theoretical courses, where we learned about the main risks and how to know what is going on in our bodies while underwater and how to deal with it,</li>
    <li>the swimming pool drills,</li>
    <li>and the main event: the open water ocean dives!</li>
</ul>
The first breath I took underwater had a warm and tingly feeling, it felt so natural that I quickly forgot that a minute ago I had to go up for air and started getting comfortable with my new underwater family. Even the fish accept you as their slow-moving, bubble-blowing, clumsy-looking equal underwater. They don't seem to care too much that you are around and some actually accidentally bump into you while they are on their way to the fish spa (that is actually a thing!).

Where's up, where's down?

### paragraph
The underwater is a whole other world and is so mind blowing. Fish have a full blown community down there; they have places to be and errands to run in their daily routine. You can see them protecting their <a href='http://bio390parasitology.blogspot.com/2011/03/nemo-really-does-finding.html'>spaghetti-tree houses (anemones)</a>, scavenging for food, roaming around, or getting their spa done. At the "cleaning stations" the cleaner fish provide parasite removal services, which is an amazing form of cleaning symbiosis. You can even witness truce areas, where it's not accepted for bigger fish to attack smaller ones as well as war zones for territory expansion or just feeding frenzies.

Recording our first dives in our log books

### paragraph
Part of our diving course material was to perform underwater skills, such as removing our masks and putting them back on while submerged, sharing oxygen with our buddy in case of an emergency, swimming through hoops and a bunch of other fun underwater drills. It felt so liberating to know that we have so much flexibility to perform such activities underwater and a little leak in our mask does not require a freak out or a trip to the surface. Navigation was also a really cool skill to learn as, surprise surprise, Google Maps navigation mode does not work down there! We had to learn how to use a conventional compass and get information from our surroundings to pinpoint our underwater location and route.

Ocean Buddhas

### paragraph
Overall, it was a memorable and exhilarating experience. I don't think I will ever forget the first underwater breath, the gravity-free feeling or all the amazing hours of pretending to be part of the school of fish. Thank you Jacko for being adventurous and making my dream come true. James and Katie you unlocked an entire new world for us to explore! Philip, Anna, Steffi and Johan you were the best team ever to go through this with.
