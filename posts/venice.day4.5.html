Adriatic By Bike: Day 4, 5
Trieste
Italy

<p>
We made it to our last stop in Italy, Trieste. After some long biking days its finally time for a rest day. We decided to spend an extra day in Trieste and leave our poor hamstrings to relax and detox from biking for a day. We also decided to splurge and share an Airbnb room that was only €4 more expensive than camping... Great find!

</div>

<p>
Trieste is an adorable and picturesque city. It has a small town feeling, and is walkable while still big enough to have plenty of things to do and is very lively. People are out and about at all kinds of hours of the day and night. We also learned that the people of Trieste are most similar to Austrian culturally than Italian due to the fact that they were under Austrian rule between the 1300-1900.

<p>We strolled around and got our first <strong>Capo in B</strong> at San Marco cafe. <strong>Capo in B</strong> is Trieste style Cappuccinos served in a tiny glass mug, so cute! And of course we could not stay away from the Italian tiramisu (Jack’s favorite!)

<p>Piazza Unità d'Italia and the Castello di San Giusto are some of the city highlights. Apparently the castle’s architecture was later characterized as “useless” against a potential attack, but thankfully Trieste was a pretty peaceful place so it was never actually put to the test!

With all this walking and exploring we lost track of time and in growing desparation realized that it was past 3pm and we were starving. You see, Trieste, being a small city in Italy, takes “nap time” very seriously (disregarding their Austrian heritage) and most of the places that serve food are closed between 3-7pm. What a disaster for our empty stomachs! Thankfully you can always find a gelateria close by and yes, some of them even serve pizzas for the desparate ones of us.
</p>

<p>
And as our Italian was getting better (<i>translation</i>: we became excellent at using our hands in an exaggerated way so that we would fit in), we leave the town of Trieste to go towards Slovenia. More adventures to come...
