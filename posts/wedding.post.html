Lebanese Wedding
Beirut
Lebanon
<p>
	We were lucky enough to have met wonderful friends in Berkeley.
	But we are even luckier that we get to share experiences outside Berkeley with them, such as this one, Tala and Marwan's wedding in Lebanon. Their wedding took place at the beginning of July in Beirut and, needless to say, it was an experience of a lifetime.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the wedding, it was an opportunity for us to visit Lebanon, a country with so much history and interesting dynamics
	that was not on our radar when planning this trip.
	We made a full overview post on that trip so if you are interested in reading more about beautiful Lebanon scroll to that one (First Stop: Lebanon)!
</p>
<p>
	Well back to the wedding...
	It was such a pleasure to take this trip and spend time with dear old friends from Berkeley but also make so many new ones!
	The event took place at a really nice resort in Swan Lake and yes there was a swan lake!
	We all cleaned up nicely and waited to be amazed.

	The celebration the bride and groom arranged for us was everything we could have asked for: beautiful location, more beautiful people, and amazing food from all around the world (yes, that is a giant paella pictured!)

	The DJs and live bands made for a lively after-party.
	Among the memorable moments was the entrance of the couple, where Marwan (the groom) came in accompanied by all his guy friends, a drum circle and lots of cheering.
	Then we all saw Tala (the bride) walk in with her dad and the party started on the dance floor.
	Those Lebanese know how to party!
	And of course Jack and Zack had to contribute to the party by going on staging and performing with the band :)
