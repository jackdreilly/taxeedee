Volunteering in Bangli
Bangli, Bali
Indonesia

### paragraph

It wouldn't be a Taxeedee country without exploring its volunteering Workaway world! This time, we set aside a week towards the end of our time in Bali to visit the Brilliant College school for English and "Hospitality" in a small village in the Bangli regency. With little scheduled work during the days, we spent our week getting to know the young adults of the college, learning about their aspirations and difficulties, and sharing with them some stories about the other side of the world they dream about.

### paragraph

Against the backdrop of our defeating volunteering experience in Java (story at the bottom of the post), we decided to put its bitter taste behind us and try our hand at one more Workaway in Bali. We were picked up in Ubud by a kind and knowledgable schoolteacher from Brilliant College named Dewa, and, after an hour of stories about Bali culture from Mr. Dewa, found ourselves at the "campus" we would call home for the next 7 days. The school is not a traditional school, and can be better understand as the residence of our host, Mr Wayan, with an additional building to house lessons for the paying students. The first impression of the property is that you've arrived in Hindu-Disneyland. Small, immaculate lawns and Koi ponds are adorned with <a href="https://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/ganesha-the-god-who-rides-rats.html">colorful, cartoonish statues of elephant headed gods (Ganesha!) riding mouse-vehicles</a> and Saraswati positioned next to the brilliant plumage of a peacock. After getting used to the surroundings, we actually found the decor rather scenic and relaxing over time.

### paragraph

The campus is equally as busy as Disneyland, where family, students, and staff can be found at literally all hours of the day, chatting, working, eating, supporting. It's immediately apparent that this place is more than a tutoring company to everyone; it's a place of family and community, and Mr. Wayan is universally seen as a mentor to these aspiring young adults.  It even serves as a second-home for students who are having family problems, or simply are too sleepy to go home after chatting into the late hours.

Lovely students of Brilliant College

### paragraph

<h3>"I want to improve my economy!"</h3>

The adoration of Mr. Wayan, the central figure on campus, is easy to understand after one learns the primary function of the school: as a pipeline of young workers onto international cruiselines. Every person we met in the village saw the cruiseline industry as the golden ticket to prosperity for themselves and their future families. And, while Mr. Wayan doesn't directly possess these golden tickets, he has the connections to the hiring agents via his own past as a cruiseline worker. Thus, the ostensible function of the school as a means of teaching English and hospitality functions (serving food, ice breakers, cleaning, etc...) gives way to the real story that Mr Wayan gets his students direct interviews with his "bosses" in the industry. On our first day, we were able to witness the hub-bub of interview day, where 60 of the Brilliant College students dressed in their finest to vie for 4 openings with "Royal Caribbean". Every single student we met had only the single aspiration "improving their economy" to avoid the difficulties that they experienced growing up and the plodding and wearysome work-life of their parents.

JB teaching English or learning Balinese???

### paragraph

The prospect of landing a job on a ship truly is life-changing for these kids. While failure to secure employment in the tourism industry pretty much guarantees the extremely low income of agrarian work (an uncertain salary of around a dollar a day), even jobs in the local, bustling tourism market of Ubud is a measly salary of less then $100 a month. Thus, every student has their eyes set on the international seas, where salaries can reach $3000 a month, with 8 months guaranteed work a year. After a few years on the ship, a Balinese person will return to their village, with ample savings to build a home, start a family, and pursue whatever entrepreneurial idea that comes their way (Mr. Wayan had his hand at a chicken-farming enterprise before settling on creating his source of students for the cruiseline pipeline).

### paragraph

With the power that the cruiseline agents hold in Bali over these hopeful students comes some of the sordid biproduct of power imbalance. We witnessed one of our friends come back from a crushing defeat at the US Embassy in distant Jakarta due to misleading advice from his agent. He had dropped a large portion of his family's savings on transportation and medicals required to obtain a working Visa from the embassy, only to return empty-handed due to a simple technicality which could have been easily detected beforehand. He was utterly dejected for days, and even made facetious references to suicide.  Additionally, several of our student friends had been kept waiting for months on end for paperwork to come back from an agent who has made vague and inconsistent promises. They simply have no other choice but to put their trust in these unreliable figures. At any rate, such is the power that a bright economic future holds over these kids.

<h3>The Volunteer's Day at Brilliant College</h3>

Life is slow in Bangli. The staff, mostly young ex-students waiting their turn to board the ship, arrive early and leave late, but are never rushing. Their day is large parts social, chatting away with the other staff and joking around with us, maybe with some typing, filing, and phone calls in between. You can see that there's largely nothing "next-up" in their day or week, simply waiting for the next interview opportunity.

### paragraph

The sedate pace infected us early, as we learned to enjoy our time sitting with the students and staff, helping them to practice their English and socializing skills. As these are the skills that will largely set them apart in the interview, we were more than happy to help. Many students were eager to pull up a chair with us, and discuss the different sights we had seen in Bali, or hear our description of what busy life in America is like. Many of the students had rarely left the quiet district of Bangli, and almost noone had left the Bali island. Thus, it was fascinating to open up their minds to the larger world, stoking their desire to get off the island.

### paragraph

Occasionally, Mr. Wayan would line up a "tour" for the day, where two or three students would accompany Olga and I to a nearby local or tourist attraction. I believe this to be an excellent win-win idea for the students and the volunteers, as the students can enjoy the one-on-one English time and confidence boost they receive from genuine English exchange, and the volunteers get to see some of the local culture along the way, aiding the students without all the overhead and stuffiness of a classroom or tutoring session. We only wish that there had been more opportunities to go out with the students, and more students available to take part in the exchange.

### paragraph

In particular, we had a fascinating excursion to a nearby "Holy Water Springs", where religious devotees navigate up river currents and small cliffs on foot to reach an array of scattered prayer sites. At each one, the visitor would make a prayer intention and offering to the adjoining statue, then perform a ritualistic purification with the nearby river or small waterfall. The ritual involved three splashes of the face, followed by three to the top of the head, and finally a complete submersion. Part adventure, part prayer, part exercise, part play, we loved our time, and had great conversation with our student escorts for the day.

We were also lucky enough to be joined one day by Andrea and JB, two French friends we had met in Ubud, who went on a local tour of a waterfall with our student friend "Desi".

<h3>Ours friends, Wayan, Wayan, and Wayan!</h3>

Not initially tipped off by the three or four "Wayan Guesthouse" and "Wayan Restaurant" locations in Ubud, we finally figured out that the Balinese have a rather simple child-naming procedure when 4 out of the first 5 people we met at the campus were named "Wayan". We were not in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(film)">stuck in a Michael Keaton movie plot</a>, but rather we learned they are named according to the order of their birth, with (unsurprinsingly) "Wayan" being given to the first-born (along with a couple other less-prominent choices like Putu and Gede), "Made" for the second-born, "Komang" for the third, after which the names become much less common due to family planning initiatives in Indonesia. Even girls can be dubbed "Wayan", making no distinction of the gender in the naming process.

### paragraph

Thus, it was easy enough to take an educated guess at the name of any new acquaintance. We had, of course, our host Wayan. Then, there was "rocker Wayan", who sang Guns-n-Roses and Ed Sheeran songs for tourists in the streets of Denpasar (although, his primary occupation was waiting to pass the cruiseline interview). There was Wayan, the nervous yet grateful youngster whom we helped to prepare for his approaching interview by asking him questions about his favorite food and his girlfriend. And, last but not least, there was little Wayan (the cousin of Wayan...), who could be seen trying to impress us with cartwheels and his latest trick of trying to stand on his head.

Speaking of youngsters, while the legal driving age in Bali is supposedly 17, it was not uncommon to see pre-adolescent boys and girls revving up and down the narrow roads of Bangi all by themselves, or with their <em>younger</em> siblings in tow!  It's at first incredibly disconcerting to see a boy barely tall enough to see over the handlebars hurtling towards you on their scooter, but amazingly, like most experiences in Asia, you simply get used to it. Eventually, you don't give a second thought to entrusting your safety to the motorized tots and rather enjoy the breezy scootin through the jungle.

<h3>Om Swasiastu!</h3>

While our seven days at the college ended up feeling a bit too long (I suppose we get restless, or couldn't do another day of Indonesian village food!), we've already looked back with great memories of our time in Bangli. It was fascinating to get a glimpse into the lives of a younger generation that has almost no relation to the "Millenials" back home. Their aspirations are concrete and easy to understand: improve my economy! And they set about doing it without complication, and enjoying the laid-back ride along the way.  Certainly at times, the lifestyle and philosophy came off as overly simplistic, where fate was put up to the gods, and their ambition and imagination pigeonholed into a single predetermined route. But along with this, we met great people who were easy to connect to and immediately let us into their lives and made us feel like equal members of the village. We tried our best to return the favor with whatever we had to offer, be it English, encouragement, some Acroyoga lessons, or our meager attempts at learning the Balinese language. In particular, we had the pleasure of daily chats and gossips with the staff girls, Arni, Melanie, Mira, Dwee, and Mari, who we hope have great futures ahead of them, exploring the world be it by cruiseship or otherwise. Suksma! Salam Kanal! Om Santi Santi, Santi Om!!!

<h3>Coda: Tough times in Java</h3>

The following is a completely separate story of our "failed" volunteering time in Java, for the interested reader. Sarcasm and cynicism ahead:

### paragraph

Our trip to Bangli was not our only volunteering "attempt" in Indonesia.  When we first arrived in Indonesia from Chiang Mai, we slept on the concrete floor outside the domestic airport for 4 hours, waiting for a morning flight to Yogyakarta in nearby Java. We were to start a Workaway project with an English school the following afternoon.  The project had over 100 positive reviews, and appeared to be a good fit, allowing us to help on a project and meet locals along the way.

### paragraph

Sadly, we never found such a fit on this project. For starters, Olga came down with a vicious fever (>100F!), and stayed in bed for an entire day, certainly impacting our mood and enthusiasm. As well, we were very disappointed in the day-to-day experience. We slept 45 minutes away from our place-of-work in the home of our host, and felt trapped being so isolated from the volunteering location. Even then, when the day came to work, we found ourselves all alone, with no communication of how we would arrive at the school. Olga sat in bed (recovering) waiting the entire day for a response from our host, who was apparently too busy to respond to her questions. This was starkly different from our other Workaways, where communication was clear, and there was plenty of obvious or self-motivated work to get done in a day.

### paragraph

Even when we eventually made it to the school, I spent 90% of the day with nothing to do, sitting in the  commercial tutoring academy, with noone caring whether I was there or not (luckily I can always entertain myself with work or reading). The children I taught and staff I worked with came off as quite apathetic to our existence.  Coming from the welcoming embrace of the Nepalese children and villagers in Heaven Hill, this was demotivating, and made us feel invisible and without a sense of purpose.

### paragraph

On top of this, I felt a growing discomfort with our host. Based on discussions with a similarly-dispirited volunteer whom had stayed with the host a year prior, the host had apparently become more devout and consumed by his Muslim faith. We also witnessed this, and believe it was a large attributing factor for his seeming lack-of-care or -passion for the volunteering program. In addition to the more common private prayer, he attended mosque upwards of five times a day, eating much of his time.

### paragraph

As well, he was dedicated days a week to his new-found love of "Qu'ran-based healing". Particularly fascinating and worrying, he described in detail this completely mystical practice to me, which was founded by a secretive Indonesian doctor who let only a select-few Muslim commoners in on his new cult, and otherwise kept his methodology under wraps. In short, it involves interpreting cryptic statements in the Qu'ran to inspire one to apply external body-touching techniques, with the purported ability to heal pretty much any ailment that occurs to humans.  With a straight face, he said that all cancers, strokes, and any internal problem could be completely cured in minutes following his therapy. For instance, he shared one such attempt to heal a volunteer who was suffering from urinary pains (UTI, anyone?). He deftly concluded that her hips were too tight, and treated her with hip mobility movements. He was deeply disappointed to learn that her problems relapsed. The sarcastic tone I'm taking here is mostly to underline the frustration we had with the disorganization of our time in Java.

### paragraph

After a day and a half in Java, we made the decision to cut our losses and leave immediately. We found little point in dedicating a week of our time to such an incompatible project. We informed the host family of our early departure and headed out for the airport for our return to Bali. Our host asked many times for the opportunity to perform therapy on Olga, which added to our desparation to escape. Luckily, the domestic airfare and transportation were all very cheap, and the only sunk-cost was a day and a half of our time, and our profit was the quirky story of failure above.
