Life in India: Traffic
Kerala
India

### paragraph 
If you have only ever driven on American or European streets, then you'll have NO idea what I am about to talk about. Traffic in India is just crazy. No, not in a bumper to bumper kind of situation. Instead, imagine an electric field with ions trying to sort themselves out by going around each other in a chaotic, yet careful way. That's the best illustration I can think to characterize how cars, pedestrians, buses, motorcycles, cows, goats and dogs move around the Indian streets. It's beautiful to watch!

### paragraph
They have developed a unique navigational system which totally works, if you are familiar with it! Everyone predicts the other person's/animal's movement and adapts their own to avoid collision at all costs, all the while, taking advantage of every spare inch of pavement. If there is any, even the slightest space in front of you, you are required to claim it, most of the times resulting in your car being squished in between a dumpster, a cow and other vehicles. I want to see those AI engineers try and build a car that can navigate this good!

### paragraph
And this leads to my next observation: honking. We tried to play a game and count the seconds in between honks heard, and quickly realized that units of millseconds would be required. Albeit noisy, after some experience on the road, one can discern a form of language emerging from the cacophany of horns.

### paragraph 
Different "messages" one can witness on the roads include:
<ul>
  <li>“hey, look out I am right behind you”,</li>
  <li>“car is coming from the other side”,</li>
  <li>“I am going to go around you now”,</li>
  <li>“don’t change direction”,</li>
  <li>“change direction”,</li>
  <li>“stop”, "go", and so on...</li>
</ul>

Our personal favorite is a common exchange where two vehicles, whom have already passed one another by a couple seconds, will then emit a friendly "well done chap", and "bravo" honk to signal a successful maneuvering.

It's a new language invented here where duration, frequency, intensity and volume of honking counts.


### paragraph
Daily commuting here requires an amount of resilience and adaptability to unexpected circumstances, as well as an expectation of arriving later than expected, something we leared was called as "India time". You may be required to exit your car to help clear some rubble from the side of the road. Or you may need to come to an extended halt as a herd of cows are sheperded directly towards you. The saying "expect the unexpected" is certainly apt.

### paragraph 
The resolution of a traffic jams is an interesting experience. All my geometry lessons on how objects move around each other cannot explain how 2 buses managed to successfully make it through a narrow, congested mountain pass intact.

### paragraph 
Note to self: They drive on the left side of the street <i>but not always</i>, so look both ways twice (scratch that, four times) before crossing!
