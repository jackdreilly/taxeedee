Life in India: Traffic
Kerala
India

### paragraph 
If you have ever drove on an American or European street then you have NO idea what I am talking about. Traffic in India is just crazy. No, not in a bumper to bumper kind of situation, imagine an electric field with ions trying to sort themselves out by going around each other in a perfect chaotic way. Thats the best illustration I can think to characterize how cars, pedestrians, buses, motorcycles, cows and dogs move around the Indian streets. It's beautiful to watch!

### paragraph
They have some sort of system that totally works when it comes to navigating the streets. Everyone predicts the other persons/animals movement and adjusts their own to avoid collision at all costs. I want to see those AI engineers trying to built a car that can navigate this good!

### paragraph 
And this leads to my next point: honking. We tried to play a came and count the seconds in between honks heard. I have to tell you it was impossible to count milliseconds! Although I do not know this first hand, I believe that honking here is used as a form of navigation around vehicles. 

### paragraph 
It's kind of like a communication signal. Not like how we are used to to say “hey, look out I am right behind you” but rather, “car is coming from the other side”, “I am going to go around you now”, “don’t change direction”, “change direction”, “stop”, “go” and so on. Oh, and of course some of the honks are there to just say a friendly “hello”. Its a new language invented here where duration, frequency, intensity and volume of honking counts.

City traffic

### paragraph
We recently experienced a traffic jam that occurred because two buses wanted to go on opposite directions on a street clearly not built to support that. The two buses were stuck on a turn, completely blocking the road so all motorcycles, pedestrians and other cars were piling around them looking for an opening. I thought it was a lost cause, but in a matter of minutes people starting getting off their cars, trying to make the curb larger by moving piles of rocks from the side of the road and shouting instructions to the two bus drivers. No one was frustrated about the situation, but rather eager to problem solve! And success!

### paragraph 
The resolution of a traffic jams is an interesting experience. All my geometry lessons on how objects move around each other cannot explain how the 2 buses managed to successfully make it through intact. 

### paragraph 
Note to self: They drive in the left side of the street <i>but not always</i>, so look both ways twice (scratch that, four times) before crossing!
