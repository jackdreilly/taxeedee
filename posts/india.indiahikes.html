Hiking in the Himalayas: Indian Edition
Uttarakhand
India

### paragraph
The truth is we could not wait to get to the mountains! Being in India and so close to the Himalayas, planning a hiking trip around the tallest mountains of the world seemed inevitable. As newbies in high-altitude hiking in the Himalayas, and in a country with minimal infrastructure around trails (most are unmapped, undeveloped and unmarked), we went for the safe option and signed up for a guided group trek with a company that came highly recommended to us, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThrUH4vs7Kc">India Hikes</a>.

The trekking crew

### paragraph
The company is really organized and professional, so much that they required fitness proofs from us before we could sign up, which included 2 GPS-tracked 5km runs. This would have been a challenge in itself, but being in India at the time made it even more challenging. India's roads, traffic conditions, weather etc are not very welcoming for outdoor physical activity. Nonetheless, we decided to give it a go. One afternoon in Goa, we put on our athletic gear (Olga only had her hiking boots packed so that would have to do...) and went out for a run. 

### paragraph
We instantly felt the pain, as 5 seconds in we almost got run over by cars and received a ton of honks. After turning into one side road to avoid the traffic, we ran into another unexpected occurrence: pigs. They were everywhere and were all staring right at us as we tried to keep a good running pace without being too intrusive in their environment. After the pigs came the stray dogs... They were unfortunately not as "chill" as the pigs and we got chased quite a few times adding some heat to our pace. The runs also made us the town's celebrities, as everyone that we talked to after mentioned seeing us running on the roads. I guess we were the only weirdos that were running in the 30 degree weather without being chased by anything (most of the time!). Long story short, we managed to submit our running times and got accepted for the trek a few days later.

Photographic evidence of our sweaty homework

### paragraph
After a long, long, long bus ride from Dehradun we arrived at Sankri, a remote village in the mountains, the launching point of our trek. Despite being tired and dizzy from the 10 hour drive, Sankri amazed us with its unique mountain character and views. The local people, all wearing their cute "mountain outfits", looked so hard-working and tough. Most of the locals are involved with farming, products of which help them survive (as, I guess ,their resupply of goods does not happen all that often being isolated in the mountains) and they also export to the rest of India.

Sankri views

### paragraph
Early the next morning the hike began. We were in a group with 16 other trekkers and were accompanied by a guide, 2 trek leaders, a support team of 4 locals and our faithful mules that were carrying the tents, sleeping bags, cooking supplies, foods and all other surviving gear for our 4 days in the mountains. In the first few minutes of the hike we already started picking up a few Hindi phrases from our local guide, Guddu, as he would always yell "Saava" ("awesome) and "Chalo chalo" ("lets go") to encourage our uphill struggles. People were also very passionately talking about "Maggie", who we assumed was some girl on the trip. Only later did we discover we were wrong; at this isolated hut in the middle of a beautiful meadow, a couple of girls were cooking some instant noodles of the popular Indian brand "Maggie"! They were delicious we had to admit, and a perfect reward for the 2 hours of uphill battle we had just overcome.

### paragraph
Reaching camp, we were introduced to the sleeping rules. India Hikes has strict rules for sleeping as men and women have to be separated in different tents; whether married or not, rules are rules. While I understand that the rules are there to make all campers feel comfortable with the sleeping situation, it came as a surprise for us. We embraced the rules and slept in separate tents, but especially the night when I was feeling sick, it would have been nice if Jack was in the tent for emotional support. I would have felt more at home and more comfortable to wake him up everytime I had to go out at night or just needed water.

### paragraph
The other order of business in camp were our health measurements. India Hikes is very professional when it comes to safety on the mountain and made sure to take everyones vitals (oxygen level and heart rate) multiple times a day. I can't even describe the stress we had to go through every time our turn would come, staring at the numbers on the screen, scared that we would not make the cut and would have to be sent down the mountain... Hopefully we were good for all the measurements and Jack even got the "fittest person" award for his impressively low heart rate.

Jacko the mountain man

### paragraph
Breakfasts, lunches and dinners were all prepared by the Sherpas following along on the trek. The work they put in the preparation and variety in the food they made was impressive. The only drawback was my low tolerance for spicy food. India, in general, was tough in the spice department, but being in the mountain and having no other food source was challenging. The best day for me was when Chowmein was on the menu and I scarfed down 2 days worth of noodles. Jack on the other hand did everything he could to make the food even more spicy for his experienced palate.

After two full days of huffing and puffing on the uphill part, we made it to spectacular ridge sitting at 3600 meters (12000 feet) and were rewarded with some amazing 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains.

### paragraph
The last day of the trek we woke up to a white surprise! It had snowed a bit during the night and there was a soft white blanket covering the ground. It was beautiful to see how that changed the entire landscape around us. At the same time, it was a good reminder that climate in the mountains can be really unpredictable and change from blue sunny skies to a storm in no time. The best part about the snowy day was our fellow trekkers reaction to it. It was just adorable to see everyone's inner child come to life as most of them were experiencing snow for the first time in their lives! Although delightful, snow can add complications to the trek. Thankfully, Jack, who absolutely adores his Chacos, was convinced in the beginning of the trip to also carry hiking boots with him. Otherwise his poor toes would have suffered big time in the snow!

Oh yes, it's cold!

### paragraph
The hike ended in Taluka, where the first breath of civilization smelled a little funny to us... By looking around we realized that we walked into a pot plantation! The biggest marijuana plants we had ever seen were just growing on the side of the street (they were at least 6 feet high and growing everywhere!).

### paragraph
The final adventure of the trip was the way back to Sankri. The road connecting Taluka to Sankri unfortunately suffered a landslide which was yet to be fixed. So, the solution was to take a jeep up to the landslide point, walk through the landslide, and get on a different jeep on the other side! But how can you fit 16 people and a few locals on a couple of jeeps? Of course, put some of them on the top!

### paragraph
Our trek provided a great exposure to high-altitude hiking and to the efforts India Hikes for responsible and ecological trekking. India Hikes has launched the "Green Trails" program which aims to protect the natural mountain beauty from the drawbacks of commercialization. The increase of people visiting the mountains has resulted in large amounts of trash being generated, with the locals turning a blind eye as they benefit from the increased tourism. It is the first time that we have witnessed this much trash on nature trails. On multiple occasions we have witnessed somebody finishing their drink or food and, without thinking twice, throwing the trash on the ground or outside of the bus window. India Hikes supporting the "zero waste" initiative gave everyone "green" bags to collect as much trash as one could to enable the cleaning up process of the mountains. Maybe starting from the mountains, this initiative can grow and influence all parts of India where trash on the streets is a reality.

It was refreshing and inspiring meeting and spending time with young Indians who are just as passionate about the outdoors as we are. We witnessed strong signs that the next generation of Indians are embracing sustainable practices, responsible interactions with nature, and overall healthier lifestyles which will only better serve the future of their beautiful, chaotic country.
