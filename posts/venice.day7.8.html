Adriatic By Bike: Day 7 & 8
Piran
Slovenia

### paragraph

Following the Parenzana from the Italy-Slovenia border we finally landed in Piran!  

### paragraph

  But before we engage in all the touristy sightseeing, we had to find a campsite. Our navigational instincts and our “in Google we trust” attitude, didn’t really work out this time as we ended up in the top of a 10% decent slope footpath with dense vegetation and stairs! We slowly walked our bikes down the hill and set up our home for the night.

Descent down to the camping

### paragraph

  The camping as we were told at the reception is on the beach. We decided to ride our bikes into town and at the same time check out the beach. The “beach” (our apologies for the use of the term to all our Greek friends) was a concrete path along the cliff, where people were having a blast enjoying the water. A little spoiled from our previous weeks in Greece, we skipped the beach and instead headed into the center of Piran, which had a lot more to offer.

The “beach”

### paragraph

  The town of Piran is truly amazing. As we learned, Piran has been stuck in time for the last 200 years as it was passed between a few different empires but was mostly neglected by the rulers. Its medieval architecture remains mostly unchanged today so the entire town has a feeling that you just stepped into a time capsule.

The main square

### paragraph
  Due to its location on a peninsula, the view from Piran is magnificent. You can actually see 3 countries from the location of the main church as illustrated below. We tried to take it all in and strolled around the town and visited the medieval wall built to protect the city from inland forces (Ottomans). The lighthouse, as we were surprised to learn, was also the city’s main church until last year! Now it’s converted to an art museum.

Roman catholic churches are really impressive

### paragraph

  The next day we packed up our “home” and continued on the Parenzana towards Croatia. This was our first actual border crossing as we needed to exit the Schengen zone and enter Croatia. There were 2 stations for passport control: one for exiting Slovenia and, just a few meters up, one for entering Croatia. I guess we were in no-man’s land there for a little bit!

  Croatia welcomed us with some delicious food at a local Konoba (Croatian Taverna) and the local treats, goulash and sausages!
