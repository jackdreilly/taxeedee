<h4>3:00-5:00 PM: Afternoon Work</h4>

After a quick bite to eat and a nap, the volunteers have a very calm afternoon working on more tasks with the pups: taking Chi Wit and Peanut for another walk, letting Mousey, the elderly Gramma pup, explore the fields, and a few more poo checks. As the day finishes, Olga would perform her favorite chore of the entire day: putting sweaters on puppies!

On top of the daily chores, we also experienced several special events during our tenure. Three puppies were adopted by lovely Thai families. One adoption arose after we passed by a local farmer on our daily walk whom instantly fell in love with our dear Dakini, and popped by Ryan's shelter the following morning to begin the adoption process. It was special to see the rehabilitation cycle complete from abandoned puppy to full adoption, making our work on the farm feel particularly fulfilling.

We also felt some of the profound sadness one encounters working with sick and vulnerable animals. Ryan took in sweet Jing Jok after reports of him being stuck in bushes trying to flee fireworks on New Years. After a couple of days of rehab attempts, attention and love, it was clear that Jing Jok was in unbearable pain and the years of street life had taken a severe toll on his body. The compassion for the new dog became a strong sadness after several days of heartwrenching howling and the realization that his suffering could not be saved.

Introducing Katie!

Our story wouldn't be complete without a tribute to our rascally mascot, Katie. The most diminutive pup on the property, Katie endured incessant harrassing from the older dogs. Yet, she was quick to defend herself, and eventually was punching way beyond her weight-class.

As she lived on our side of the property, we had extra Katie play time in the evenings before bed. Thus, we were a bit dispirited when she was forced to move to the fenced-in property due to neighborhood politics and her curiosity of neighbors' yards. It was then to our surprise to find her waiting at our bedroom porch late one night, wiggling her body, proud of her heroic escape! We later discovered the "prison tunnel" hole that she had dug in the corner of the yard, the first successful jailbreak on the property, according to Ryan. Classic Katie stuff...

After two full weeks of pups, we learned to love the different personalities of the dogs, and felt a pride in knowing that we were bringing joy to the lives of so many furry souls. But we felt particularly lucky to have shared our two weeks with two new friends, Laura and Matyas, fellow volunteers and all around fantastic people. We also had a wonderful reunion with Nepal Workawayers, Niels and Griet, whom we had luckily convinced to share our New Years with. Numerous times, Olga and I found ourselves shaking our heads with our luck of the draw with our volunteering trips, and the quality of the connections we have made.

We're grateful for the friends, the work, the lessons, our fearless leader, Ryan, and of course, for all the four legged friends we got to care for and cuddle these two weeks. Goodbye Pai!!!
