<p>

After our <a href="/post/Volunteering at Heaven Hill Academy">first Workaway experience teaching in Nepal</a>, we were eager to find another opportunity in Thailand. While idling away in serene Chiang Mai, and with two weeks of time available, we received a opportune response from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ryan.godden.5">Ryan</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/petes_mission/">Pete's Mission</a> dog sanctuary, inviting us to join him at the shelter over Christmas and New Years. The next morning, we were on a three-hour van to Pai, excited to play with puppies for the next two weeks.

<h3>Life of Pai</h3>

Traveling in Southeast Asia, one is bound to hear about the charming, little village of Pai, often billed as the quieter and less-touristy version of Chiang Mai. While this may have been the case ten years ago, it takes only a few minutes walking around Pai's hippie-and-bro-choked streets to learn that the secret's out. The food is heavily geared towards the backpacking crowds, serving everything from lasagna to Mexican baked potato, while the bar scene attracts the rowdiest of Brits.

### paragraph

That being said, the town positively exudes charm.
Each night, we enjoyed the market lights reflecting off the River Pai while crossing the rickety bamboo bridges.
The night market had creative and delicious Thai-Western fusions, such as tea-leaf pitas and kidney bean pad-thai.
Jack was even able to enjoy high-quality jazz open-mic nights at the Jazz House.

A special treat was watching the paper lanterns above the night skies as a part of the New Years celebrations. As the tradition goes, the Thai locals will attach a worry or stress to the lantern, and then watch it float away.

So, alas, after the initial bro-tank shock wore off, we ended up loving the town of Pai, making the setting for our volunteering time all the more enjoyable.

<h3>Pete's Mission</h3>

<a href="https://petesmission.org">Pete's Mission</a> is an animal sanctuary founded and run by Ryan Godden, an Aussie with years of animal care experience. In the video below, he relates a very touching story about how the memory of his first dog, Pete, motivated him to dedicate his life to well-being of animals. Spending two weeks working closely with Ryan, we learned just how passionate he is about his mission; be it his extremely minimal lifestyle, 24-hour work ethic, dedication and espousing of vegan morals, or just his pure happiness and love he gives to the animals around him, Ryan sets an example for all volunteers about how one can make radical changes in their life and impact many through hard work and grassroots efforts.

### paragraph

The on-premises shelter is filled with 20-some-odd dogs, that required care and fostering for a variety of reasons, e.g., a deceased owner, disabling injuries, or abondoned female puppies (all too common in Thailand). Each dog takes residence until they are well enough to be adopted, return to the streets, or otherwise, take permanent residence, e.g., in the case Merkel, of the grandfather bull-terrier of the sanctuary.

While dogs feature predominantly in the daily work of the volunteers, On top of his sanctuary work, visits to street dogs in town, and veterinarian aid, Ryan spends whatever extra time remaining in his day with a variety of other animals in need of care. He looks after a nearby neglected horse, as well as a slew of pigs that he bought and rescued from slaughtering. You can often spot Ryan riding through Pai on his scooter with a side-car full of spoiling fruits and veggies for the pigs, truly a sight!

<h3>A day in the life of a volunteer</h3>

Given the daily basic needs that each dog requires, the work-days tend to take on a predictable pattern. Let's walk through a typical day of a volunteer at Pete's Mission:

<h4>7:30AM: Good Morning Puppies!</h4>
Before the real work begins, we grab a quick cup of coffee and some cereal from the kitchen. Waiting at the gate, the dogs hop up to say good morning, and trying to sneak a bite of Cocoa Puffs.

### paragraph
<h4>8:00 AM: Take the scooterdoodles for a walk</h4>

The sanctuary has three handicapped dogs: Peanut, Chi Wit, and King Richard. While King Richard is handled solely by Ryan given his behavioral quirks, Peanut and Chi Wit are walked by the volunteers every morning and afternoon. What they lack in hind legs, they make up in spunk and fire. Five minutes after dropping our backpacks at the shelter, we found ourselves dead-sprinting after 'Nut and 'Wit, as they wheeled after every chicken and non-chicken distraction at break-neck speeds.

After the walk was finished, 'Nut and 'Wit would transform into docile, cuddle-loving pups, wiggling  over to you on their front legs for a good head scratch and back massage. Jack particularly cherished the one-on-one therapy time he shared with Peanut, trying to build strength back into her weakened legs, no doubt, caused by a careless biker.

<h4>9:00 AM: Feeding Time</h4>

The four-hour morning session allows ample time for the volunteers would to complete many odd-jobs: for example,
<ul>
  <li>laundry,</li>
  <li>poo scoop,</li>
  <li>sweeping, and</li>
  <li>feeding.</li>
</ul>

Feeding, possibly the most stressful part of the day, would involve a coordinated effort across several volunteers to ensure each dog ate their allotted portion while limitting the threat of kerfuffles and shenanigans from the more-dominating dogs. Four separate eating chambers were required to execute the operation successfully, with by far the most adorable chamber belonging to the five black puppies, playing hungry hungry hippos on  the kitchen floor.

<h4>10:00 AM: Dog Walking</h4>

Once the dogs are full-bellied, it's onto the walk! Each volunteer takes a pup and a leash, and heads out to the rolling hills on the outskirts of Pai. Save for one errant fang that caught Olga on the leg (Moosey felt terrible about it afterwards), the walks were a great time for both the dogs and volunteers to socialize.

<h4>3:00-5:00 PM: Afternoon Work</h4>

After a quick bite to eat and a nap, the volunteers have a very calm afternoon working on more tasks with the pups: taking Chi Wit and Peanut for another walk, letting Mousey, the elderly Gramma pup, explore the fields, and a few more poo checks. As the day finishes, Olga would perform her favorite chore of the entire day: putting sweaters on puppies!

On top of the daily chores, we also experienced several special events during our tenure. Three puppies were adopted by lovely Thai families. One adoption arose after we passed by a local farmer on our daily walk whom instantly fell in love with our dear Dakini, and popped by Ryan's shelter the following morning to begin the adoption process. It was special to see the rehabilitation cycle complete from abandoned puppy to full adoption, making our work on the farm feel particularly fulfilling.

We also felt some of the profound sadness one encounters working with sick and vulnerable animals. Ryan took in sweet Jing Jok after reports of him being stuck in bushes trying to flee fireworks on New Years. After a couple of days of rehab attempts, attention and love, it was clear that Jing Jok was in unbearable pain and the years of street life had taken a severe toll on his body. The compassion for the new dog became a strong sadness after several days of heartwrenching howling and the realization that his suffering could not be saved.

Introducing Katie!

Our story wouldn't be complete without a tribute to our rascally mascot, Katie. The most diminutive pup on the property, Katie endured incessant harrassing from the older dogs. Yet, she was quick to defend herself, and eventually was punching way beyond her weight-class.

As she lived on our side of the property, we had extra Katie play time in the evenings before bed. Thus, we were a bit dispirited when she was forced to move to the fenced-in property due to neighborhood politics and her curiosity of neighbors' yards. It was then to our surprise to find her waiting at our bedroom porch late one night, wiggling her body, proud of her heroic escape! We later discovered the "prison tunnel" hole that she had dug in the corner of the yard, the first successful jailbreak on the property, according to Ryan. Classic Katie stuff...

After two full weeks of pups, we learned to love the different personalities of the dogs, and felt a pride in knowing that we were bringing joy to the lives of so many furry souls. But we felt particularly lucky to have shared our two weeks with two new friends, Laura and Matyas, fellow volunteers and all around fantastic people. We also had a wonderful reunion with Nepal Workawayers, Niels and Griet, whom we had luckily convinced to share our New Years with. Numerous times, Olga and I found ourselves shaking our heads with our luck of the draw with our volunteering trips, and the quality of the connections we have made.
