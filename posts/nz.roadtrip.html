<h3>Day 1</h3>
In the morning we started our road trip, we left our hostel. Good riddance, as our room smelled of stale beer and staler vomit. We caught an Uber over to Wicked Campers, which also greeted us with a similar musty, musky smell, and appeared to be operated and managed by hungover undergrads. Luckily, our good fortune increased from there, as we were automatically upgraded to a bigger, self-contained camper, which permitted us to stay in many more camping locaitons, and enjoy a more spatious sleeping/hanging experience. We also raided the second-hand pile of goods left by campers-past, and made out with a sleeping bag, pillows, blanket, gas canister, hot water bladder, and shampoo/body wash, freakin score!

Before heading out on the road, we stopped for our last prepared meal (coffee, eggs and toast) from a diner across the street. It would be largely our own cooked meals from there on. After 4-5 hours of getting used to the handling of the larger van (Olga had to keep reminding me that I was pouring over the left-hand divider), we arrived at Lake Tilapo, and made quick work of a short hike to a lookout point over the lake before the late sunset. We made our way to our first camping location of the trip after a hot tip from a fellow tourist. Fifteen minutes on a bumpy, dirt road, and we had a free, wonderful, semi-secluded campsite along a shallow river, very reminiscent of American River evening views.

We made our first meal of roasted potatoes and veggies, and scarfed it down, adjusting to the new norm of freezing at the park benches as we chow. We spotted fellow campers starting up a fire, and I went over to ask to join, which they were happy to oblige. As gifts, we brought cookies and firewood. We learned that they were 4 18 year old Germans, taking their gap year to explore New Zealand with the work-holiday visa. Two of them were much more enthusiastic about the "holiday" part of the visa, and found that two weeks of farm labor quenched their thirst for work, and headed out on their road trip from there. They were in good spirits, and were loving the road, and the van life.  When asked what were their favorite meals to cook, we were amused to hear of their newfound love of Uncle Ben's rice and instant noodle, both of which were novel to them (but not to I, who was at one point an undergrad).  The other two Germans were much more downbeat, and related to us their tribulations of buying a broken van, and dumping another $1500 and one month of sitting around to have it fixed. So much for the investment over renting. We enjoyed wrapping simple flour dough around the end of our sticks and roasting it in the fire for our German-style, pretzel-like night-time treat. We said goodbye after maybe an hour and a half, and had our first night of sleep. It was splendid, warm, and spacious, and we were relieved to learn that sleep would be hearty and satisfying for the entirety of the trip.

<h3>Day 2</h3>
After waking, we had our first of many traditional mornings of me waking  up and boiling water for coffee while stretching from the compressive forces of the hard woodboard bed and thin pad-mattress. The mornings are freezings and overcast, which makes waking up a little hard than other camping trips, but by 7:45 I'm usually in full swing. After coffee's ready, I get wrestless, and wake up Olga, who's rather fresh from the 10.5 hours. We then cook a two-pronged breakfast attack consisting of me tending to an egg-based dish (sometimes French toast, sometimes scrambled, sometimes potato hash, sometimes who knows!) and Olga preparing a yogurt/muesli/fruit concoction. In good weather, we enjoy the meal on the picnic bench or our portable table, but more often than not hide from the elements (wind, rain, sandflies) and eat on our assemblable indoor table, which is cozy yet very comfortable.

A quick scrubbing using the indoor mini-sink, a cursory glance-over the supplies to make sure their restrained and packed, and we are on our way to our first hike! We park at the Hooker Valley, abutting the Mount Cook mountain range, and get ready for a six hour, 1200 meter jaunt up the mountain side to get view of the Cook peak, and of some impressive glaciers. As the terrain is loose, rocky, and steep, the first hike is a doozy, but we always find confidence in knowing we'd already completed the Annapurnas, and these puny mountains can't even hold a candle to us. Nevertheless, we're quite pooped upon reaching the Mueller Hut. On a fellow hiker's tip, we pushed passed the hut (the prescribed stopping point), and ascended a 200 meter-tall pile of rocks behind the hut to get absolutely spectacular views of the surrounding valleys and imposing glaciers, which would occasionally unleash thunderous avalanches, much to Olga's delight. We basked in the glory only summits can bring, and then made our way down. Always quick to forget that descents can be much tiring than ascents, especially with terrible footings, we were positively drained once getting back to our van. By this time, Olga had already personified the rental into our faithful servant, Vinnie the Van, and she was ecstatic to see him and crawl into his warm embrace. That night, we hid from some gail-force winds sweeping through the valley, which had its fun destroying K-Mart tents and even sending a sturdy one ass-over-tea-kettle across the camp-ground right smack into our van.

<h3>Day 3</h3>

We cooked breakfast in the safety of the shared cooking shelter, and met an Aussie girl, who was killing time traveling the South Island by bus, hitting up some hikes along the way (we'd run into again on the Kepler Track!). We gave her a lift to the bus station, and identified a public shower to freshen up. As we had no $2 coins on hand, we had to settle for the free, freezing cold shower. Olga's trauma was severe enough that she always had at least $10 in coins on her person for the rest of the trip, and accosted me whenever I would dare to spend coins.

The rest of the day was largely driving (which is always a pleasure on the open, well-kept roads surrounding by idyllic scenery) and errand running, as we made our way to Dunedin, traversing from glaciers to sand dunes in one day. Any San Franciscan would be immediately taken aback at striking similarities in terrain and bay shores between Dunedin and the SF Bay Area. We found ourselves pointing at the NZ version of Land's End, of Sausalito, of the steep rolling roads of Polk. It was enough to make us homesick. We got lucky with another free parking spot at the start of the following day's hike, but couldn't even set up our chairs outside the van without them getting blown immediately across the parking lot. We made fried tempeh (thank you, Bali!), with boiled veggies, as we continue down our flirtations with vegetarianism and veganism. We decide that we can actually get used to the new protein source, and have even found our occasionally meat indulgences to be less and less enjoyable. We still shudder at a future without eggs and feta cheese, so we'll stick with a vegetarian diet, at least for this road trip.
