Annapurna Circuit: The Hike
Annapurna
Nepal

### paragraph
And so it begun... Our 12 day trek around the Annapurna mountain. We were thinking and talking about this trek for so long, we thought the day would never come. Arriving in Nepal, it was all we could think about, so after a quick stop in Kathmandu we made our way towards Pokhara from where we would take the bus to Besisahar, the start of the trail. 

### paragraph
Without further due, here is the summary video from our trek. Enjoy!

### paragraph
Although we are now bus experts (having been in India for over a month), the bus did not fail to "impress" us for how crowded, dirty, and slow it can be. Buses in Nepal are equally as overcrowded as the ones in India. Prolonging the misery, we got on a jeep from Besisahar to take us a little further north. If you are reading this and thinking of doing the Annapurna hike, please take our advice and avoid this jeep ride at all costs! The "road" that the jeep has to go through appears to only be accessible by goats and goatherds, and you are risking falling down a cliff at every turn. You are also jam-packed in there along with other travellers, rice bags and supplies that makes it impossible to not hit your head at the top of the jeep at every pothole, which is what mostly the road is made out of. 

### paragraph 
Enough with the logistics though, let's fast forward and get into the real thing...

Amazing river views

### paragraph
The Annapurna circuit is magnificent. The landscape changes continuously with everyday that goes by. The lower elevations are characterized by more dense vegetation, waterfalls and forest paths. As you move towards the higher elevations of the trek, the landscape gets more moon-like; the dry and harsh terrain provides some amazing views of the highest peaks in the world, all appearing as though you can reach out and touch them.

Amazing landscape

### paragraph
The trademarks of the Annapurna circuit were the hanging bridges and the prayer flags. The hanging bridges make for some really nice photos but are also essential if you want to avoid the 100 m cliffs and cross to the other side of the mountain. They are fun and scary at the same time as they wiggle with every movement and the safety measures (railing and steel bottom) are not always in tact. Strategy: Look straight in front, never down and cross without overthinking it! Every now and then, you reach a temple, a small village, a tea-house (in fact, anything related to civilization): sure enough, it will be covered in Nepali prayer flags! This gives a very fun vibe to the hike as you feel that you have made it to the checkpoint and gives you motivation to keep going and find out what's next. Bonus: perfect photo op!

### paragraph
Our days up in the mountain are pretty simple. Wake up early, enjoy a big breakfast (yes, Jack ate porridge for almost every meal), pack our backpacks and get on the road for the 10-15 km hike of the day. By the early afternoon we reached our destination for the day, a small local village with accomodations, indulged in lunch and dinner and hanged out with the other travellers for the night. Morning come, here we go again for more!

### paragraph
The local villages we passed by during the trek are truly inspiring. The simple life of the local people, so detached and remote from the rest of the world, gives you a different perspective towards life. They mostly produce everything they need themselves, from food to materials to tools, having tough enough skin to live up here all year 'round without any of the comforts that we take for granted. Their lives are so simple yet so hard. The struggles they face are so remotely different than our pampered lives. They have to make due with very little and live as integrated with nature as possible. You can see the locals working hard all day long, planting, collecting, cooking and making their own tools from whatever materials they can find in nature. So very different than just doing a quick trip to Lowe's or Berkeley Bowl...

Sunrise in the mountains

### paragraph
The accomodations in the Annapurna circuit consist of small guest houses where they offer food and rooms. The rooms are very simple, usually made out of stone or wood, with a tin roof and no insulation. The wooden windows and door have so many holes to the outside that the temperature inside is exactly the same as the one outside. In October, the weather is really nice during the day, with clear skies and sunny views of the white-capped glacial mountains. Yet, once the sun sets, the weather starts to get really cold, reaching the minus digits (degrees Celsius). You need to bundle up big time before heading to bed! Sometimes you can pay to get some hot water for a shower, but most of the time you need to tough it out and go for a few days without bathing (a cold shower was out of the question for us!). A couple of villages we stopped at have natural hotsprings nearby where you can enjoy a free hot shower!

Guesthouse

### paragraph
One of the aspects we cherished the most were the friends we made and the people we met. In the first few days, you realize that at every stop you tend to see the same people over and over again, and, in the evenings, finding them again in the guest houses. As they are mostly interesting, like-minded people (crazy enough to spend 2 weeks on the mountains), you soon become good friends and enjoy sharing the trip and the experiences. We were lucky enough to meet so many cool people along the way: Maren and Subash, Dan and Rachel, Philip and Stas, Suvi, you were all amazing and interesting people and we are glad we shared the trip with you!

Landscape views

### paragraph
The highlight of the trek was the Thorung La pass, the highest point along the way, with everyone simultaneously dreading and excitedly anticipating it. It sits at an elevation of 5,400 m (not that trivial of an altitude) and it requires a steep, long uphill hike to get to it after about 10 days of hiking in the mountains. The elevation and cold weather make it one of the hardest days on the trek and a lot of people are prone to altitude sickness at this part. After a lot of hiking days and acclimatizing, making it up to the pass gave us a lot of satisfaction and pride! It was a point for high-altitude partying for all the travellers. And it's all downhill from here...

### paragraph
We could not end this post without a proper mention of the "Dogs of Annapurna". Along with our human friends, we made so many furry ones as well. You all know <a href="/post/5bec28402a890c00011ce9bb">Silly-Milly</a> by now from our previous post. Blacky, a faithful shepherd mix, accompanied us for a couple of days on the trek and was hunting down the "Blue Sheep" everytime he smelled them hiding in the bushes, providing us with a lot of entertainment and sightings of the famous mountain animal. All the "Scruffies" along the way were adorable, and, of course, we cannot fail to mention all the little puppies that we got to hold! Just look at all those tiny faces!
