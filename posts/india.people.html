Life in India: People

India

### paragraph 

We just started our trip to India: The land of <a href="https://www.indiacelebrating.com/essay/unity-in-diversity-essay/">diversity, unity</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-the-best-examples-for-India-a-land-of-paradoxes/answer/Dhrumil-Tailor-1">paradoxes</a>, etc... We have been here just a week now and only explored a tiny little bit of south India, specifically, only a small portion of the Kerala and Karnataka states. But even with this tiny bit of exposure, we wanted to share some early observations, particularly those relevant to travelers of India.

### paragraph

As you learn in sociology class, we are humans and all we care about is other humans. So the most appropriate element to kick off this series of posts is: <b>People</b>. So let's just jump into it!

### paragraph

<b>...But before we do</b>: The following is likely an over-simplification of an incredibly diverse society. And no, the aim of this post is not to praise or criticize an entire culture or country based on a handful of experiences. Rather, we are hoping to distill in here a sense of what it feels like for a foreigner to visit India for the first time, in a rather raw form. As these experiences faithfully capture our initial emotions, we feel it is appropriate and useful to share, so that you may be transported into those first days immersed in a completely different and uncomfortable world, warts and all.

### paragraph

With disclaimers now out of the way...

### paragraph

What sticks out immediately upon arriving in India is how nice, polite and friendly the people are. And I don’t mean this in the structured way that societal rules require, like always saying "please" and "thank you", but a sincere courteousness. Indians are constantly smiling during conversations and, yes, in a sincere way. They are always willing to answer your questions and would never turn away with an “I am too busy right now”.

Meet our new friends, Elsiba and Tanmoy!

### paragraph 

This observation was apparent to us the moment we landed at the airport of Kochi in Kerala. Usually, (at least from our experiences at the European and American airports) people working in security are very serious, stand-offish and make you feel as though you have done something wrong. In contrast, the Indian security people treated us with big smiles and, as the airport was not really busy at the time, helped us fill out the appropriate forms, chatted with us, even googling with us our local address as we did not have it on hand.

### paragraph

Unbelievable to us but some Indians, especially the ones living in remote villages, have never seen a white person before, and they all want a selfie or photo with you when they see you! They would get so happy when you would return the big smile they were offering!

Selfies for everyone!

### paragraph 

We've also noticed that Indians are very communal, and are always trying to help each other and problem solve as a team. When a traffic jam occurs (which is often given the combination of small roads and large buses), we have witnessed people exiting their cars and calmly trying to make more space (sometimes by even moving piles of rocks around), while providing helpful cues to the driver. Like a self-organizing and cooperative entity, we have seen Indians act selflessly and with good cheer in frustrating times. I have a hard time imagining such a flowery resolution occurring in the US on a busy boulevard during rush hour.

### paragraph

Just don’t put them in front of a train or bus because...

### paragraph

When Indians have to wait to get on a bus or train all hell breaks loose. Perhaps in a bit of over-commitment to distancing themselves from their colonial English past, Indians seem to have completely outlawed queueing. If you are waiting in line for a ticket expect the person behind you and the person behind that to be shoving their hands over your shoulder to reach the cashier before you. And don’t get me started on getting on the actual bus... When you need to disembark from the bus, the window may be the safest option, as hordes of people will be rushing the entrances before you have a chance to exit.

It might be a good thing buses don't have windows...

### paragraph

We've also dealt with quite a bit of communication barriers on our trip so far. While English is ostensibly pervasive in India, the skill level is not equal across different age and education levels, with young professionals the most fluent. Those first experiencing India will certainly feel the frustration of not being understood, not understanding what is spoken to them, and taking part in a conversation with complete disconnection between the two parties. For us, this had such repercussions (mild, albeit) as receiving food we didn't order, making stops we didn't request, and obtaining very detailed instructions for activities we were not attending.

### paragraph
A simple example of how a conversation can go wrong:
<ul>
    <li>Traveller: Is there a train from here to Hampi?</li>
    <li>Local: Yes, of course</li>
    <li>Traveller: Do you know what time?</li>
    <li>Local: Yes</li>
    <li>Traveller: What time?</li>
    <li>Local: For what?</li>
    <li>Traveller: Train to Hampi</li>
    <li>Local: There is no train to Hampi</li>
    <li>Traveller: ...</li>
</ul>

### paragraph

Part of our acclimation process has required us to read body language better, and to ask more targeted questions. This allows us to discern between a useful "yes" response from someone versus a "yes" response from an individual with no understanding of question, simply seeking the fastest way out of an unsettling situation. Some useful tricks we've identified include:

<ul>
    <li>using the barest of grammatical structure,</li>
    <li>emphasising the important words, and</li>
    <li>asking follow up questions to make sure that the answer given was actually in response to the question asked.</li>
</ul>

### paragraph

It's clear from the above that India has pulled us emotionally and simultaneously in many directions. As our experience grows, we hope to clarify our own vision of the sub-continent, ideally one that is not clouded by our preconceived notions and biases,
