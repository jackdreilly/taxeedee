### paragraph 

We just started our trip to India: The land of <a href="https://www.indiacelebrating.com/essay/unity-in-diversity-essay/">diversity, unity</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-the-best-examples-for-India-a-land-of-paradoxes/answer/Dhrumil-Tailor-1">paradoxes</a>, etc... We have been here just a week now and only explored a tiny little bit of south India, specifically, only a small portion of the Kerala state. But even with this tiny bit of exposure, we wanted to share some early observations, particularly those relevant to travelers of India.

### paragraph

As I learned in my sociology class, we are humans and all we care about is other humans. Or more specifically, for any subject matter, we mostly care about its consequences on humans, the reaction people have towards it or its benefits to humans. So the most appropriate element to kick off this series of posts is: people. So let's just jump into it!

### paragraph

<b>...But before we do</b>: The following is certainly a ludicrous over-simplification of an incredibly diverse society. And no, the aim of this post is not to praise or criticize an entire culture or country based on a handful of experiences. Rather, we are hoping to distill in here a sense of what it feels like for a foreigner to visit India for the first time, in a rather raw form. As these experiences have really dominated our first emotions, we feel it appropriate and useful to share, so that you may be transported into those first days immersed in a completely different and uncomfortable culture, warts and all.

With disclaimers now out of the way...

### paragraph

What sticks out immediately upon arriving in India is how nice, polite and friendly the people are. And I don’t mean this in the structured way that societal rules require, like always saying "please" and "thank you", but a sincerely curteousness. Indians are constantly smiling during conversations and, yes, in a sincere way. They are always willing to answer your questions and would never turn away with an “I am too busy right now”.

This observation was apparent to me the moment we landed at the airport of Koshi in Kerala. Usually, (at least from my experience at the European and American airpots I have been) people working in security are very serious, stand-offish and make you feel as though you have done something wrong. In contrast, the Indian security people treated us with big smiles and, as the airport was not really busy at the time, helped us fill out the appropriate forms, chatted with us, even googling with us our local address as we did not have it on hand.

### paragraph 

Even more general, we've noticed that Indians are very communal, and are always trying to help each other and problem solve as a team. When a traffic jam occurs (which is often given the combination of small roads and large buses), we have witnessed people exiting their cars and calmly trying to make more space (sometimes by even moving piles of rocks around), while providing helpful cues to the driver. Like a self-organizing and cooperative entity, we have seen Indians act selflessly and with good cheer in frustrating times. I have a hard time imagining such a flowery resolution occurring in the US on a busy boulevard during rush hour.

Just don’t put them in front of a train or bus because...

### paragraph

When Indians have to wait to get on a bus or train all hell breaks loose. Perhaps in a bit of over-commitment to distancing themselves from their colonial English past, Indians seem to have completely outlawed queueing. If you are waiting in line for a ticket expect the person behind you and the person behind that to be shoving their hands over your shoulder to reach the cashier before you. And don’t get me started on getting on the actual bus... When you need to disembark from the bus, the window may be the safest option, as hoardes of people will be rushing the entrances before you have a chance to exit.

### paragraph

We've also dealt with quite a bit of communication barriers on our trip so far. While English is ostensibly pervasive in India, the skill level is not equal across different age and education levels, with urban youth the most fluent.  Those first experiencing India will certainly feel the frustration of not being understood, not understanding what is spoken to them, and taking part in a conversation with complete disconnection between the two parties. For us, this has such repercussions (mild, albeit) as receiving food we didn't order, making stops we didn't request, and obtaining very detailed instructions for activities we were not attending.

### paragraph

Part of our acclimation process has required us to read body language better, and to ask more targeted questions. This allows us to discern between a useful "yes" response from someone versus a "yes" response from an individual with no understanding of question, simply seeking the fastest way out of an unsettling situation. Some useful tricks we've identified include 

<ul>
    <li>using the barest of grammatical structure,</li>
    <li>emphasising the important words, and</li>
    <li>rephrasing a question in multiple ways to obtain a variety of social signals from the other person.</li>
</ul>

### paragraph

It's clear from the above that India has pulled us emotionally and simultaneously in many directions. As our experience grows, we hope to give a crisper view of the sub-continent, ideally a view free from our current preconceptions and biases, which may be on display here.
