Life in Bali
Bali
Indonesia

### paragraph
Even though Bali is worldknown and considered one of the best destinations, it was not originally on our traveling agenda. In our minds, Bali would throw off the vibe we were going for, as we thought of it as a mainstream, touristy, resort-life oriented island. We were so wrong and I am glad we decided to visit and experience life in Bali from the inside. Bali is a very unique place. Indonesia in general, has a conservative culture but Bali and Balinese people have managed to create a completely different vibe on their island. First of all, being primarly Hindu on the island is a big enough difference to separate them from the rest of Indonesia that is mainly Muslim. This also shows on their religion, were even though Hindu, it is technically Bali-Hindu (as they call it), separating from the India religion. They have had Hindu influences, combined with Buddhism and Confucianism making their religion very specific to Bali and its history. Balinese people are know for being very open-minded and flexible when it comes to different opinions, religions and cultures making their island is very welcoming. That's how they managed to  They are proud to say that their island has been in peace for the last hundreds of years and they will do anything it takes to keep this peaceful lifestyle for the future generations.
