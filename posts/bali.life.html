Bali is Life
Bali
Indonesia

### paragraph
Even though Bali is world renowned and considered one of the best travel destinations, it was intially not on our traveling agenda. In our minds, Bali would throw off the vibe we were going for, as we thought of it as a mainstream, touristy, resort-life oriented island. We were so wrong and I am glad we decided to visit and experience life in this unique place. Large parts of Indonesia have a strict, conservative culture, but Bali and the Balinese people have managed to create a completely different culture on their island.

<h3>Religion</h3>

The most prominent difference is their religion; while Indonesia is 90% Muslim, Bali is entirely Hindu. Balinese people are known for being very open-minded and flexible when it comes to different opinions, religions and cultures, making their island very welcoming. These characteristics are also prominent in their religion, which is technically Bali-Hindu (as they call it), separating itself from the Indian religion upon which it is based. Over the years, the Hindu base religion has combined with Buddhism and Confucianism, making their religion very specific to Bali and its history. It is remarkable how they have managed to interwine all the different religions into their own instead of dismissing them. They are proud to say that their island has been in peace for hundreds of years, choosing the peaceful path of assimilation over destructive ideological exclusivity.

While our generation in the west has all but abandoned organized religion, the Balinese youth are passionate and proud of theirs. Multiple times a day, the young adults we worked with would use the on-premises family temple to pray. Some prayed to simply give praise and express gratitude for the blessings in their lives. Some others had trouble saying why they prayed; maybe they simply appreciated the quietness and solitude from their busy lives.

We had to!

Hinduism has always been an individual's religion. It avoids dogma in favor of many possible paths to happiness and spiritual fulfillment, and continually integrates its ever-growing pantheon of gods and canon of literature. The locals we met display this religious "customization" in the way they layout their houses and property, display their religious statues, and pray in their homes. Perhaps this adaptability is what keeps Hinduism alive in Bali, avoiding the datedness and staleness that turns people away from other religions.

<h3>Scootin' on Bali</h3>

Bali is incredibly beautiful. With rice fields interspersed amongst the jungle backdrop, there is never a dull scene around. Every view has postcard-potential, from tropical sunsets to the sharp geometric shapes framing the sacred temples.

The 3rd cleanest village in the World!

The best way to explore the dense, jungle landscape is on scooter. Near cities, scooters can navigate around the exasperating car congestion, and outside in the villages, they are more convenient to traverse the bumpy narrow paths. On top of the practicality, they are super fun. Many of the main attractions around Bali require at least an hour of driving, and time goes much quicker on bike with the wind blowing in your face and being immersed in the scenery. It beats hiring a taxi for the day on pretty much any dimension you can conceive, with the only exception being the more-than-occasional showers that would sneak up on us while wearing our tank-tops.

Found some good Splashes!

Jack improved his scooting skills dramatically over the course of the trip, learning to dodge his way through busy, uncontrolled intersections, and make death-defying passes on one-way roads. The only hiccup occurred when rounding a tight corner on a slick, narrow road, just as a giant tourist SUV was hogging the entire pavement. We only had time to skid out at very slow speed, simultaneously dumping the bike and jumping off safely to our feet. In fact, Jack had landed in a 180 so he could yell at the wreckless tourist, who sped away without as much as a courtesy honk.

The rest of our time on the bike was much more pleasant and permitted some unique and astounding views, which made us feel more connected to the Bali culture and nature.

<h3>Acro-Heaven</h3>

Our cherished Taxeedee devotees may have been worried at our absence from posting all of January. Rest assured, we were safe and sound, having a blast in Thailand and Bali. Our January was largely spent doubling down on our acro-yoga obsession. In Chiang Mai, we had the pleasure of participating in the incredible acro scene, which includes daily 20+ person jams at the local park, with a number of world-class teachers also present whom we were able to admire from up-close. We also disappeared for two weeks to attend a Partner Acrobatics intensive course, but will save our readers the nitty gritty of handstand practice and standing acro techniques. We only wished we had recorded our super-fun finale Lindy Hop/Acro performance!

That's a long way of saying: Bali also has a vibrant acro scene, which allows us to explore different parts of island, jamming with fellow travelers and acro-obsessees, and making great friends in the process. We religiously attended most of the Acro-jams that were organized on the island and probably practiced AcroYoga almost every day while we were here. We were so lucky to make connections with really smart, outgoing and exciting people that we can now call friends!
