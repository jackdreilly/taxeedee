Adriatic By Bike: Handling The Bad Days
Krk
Croatia

### paragraph

This post is possibly a little more “real” as compared to our other more-lighthearted ones thus far. Our 12 day bike trip around the Adriatic just came to an end, and with this experience under our belts, we feel it would be a good idea to put some thoughts down on “paper” for our future reference (and maybe yours).

### paragraph

Dooooon’t worry, everything is fine. We just want to share some insights on what to expect on “couple traveling” and what we found useful when dealing with complications that arise. To make this more concrete (and to feel less clickbaity), we‘ll give you an example of a “bad day”:

### paragraph

We arrived in Rijeka, Croatia late one night by bus (the bus experience a story for another time...):
<ul>
  <li>it's raining,</li>
  <li>our bikes require repair from bus storage mishandling, and</li>
  <li>we took a wrong turn finding our Airbnb and had to carry our bikes up no less than 100 stairs: not so tough until you consider the additional 60 lb load on each bike.</li>
</ul>

Try to carry 2 100lb bikes up here….

### paragraph

Early the next morning we decide to bike around 40 miles to get to one of the Croatian islands, Krk (yes, seriously no vowels on the name). The ride is more difficult than our previous days due to the hilly passes and hot island climate (the weather has never made up its mind the entire trip, shifting from cold and rainy to this day’s 85℉ (30℃) and sunny).

### paragraph

Once we traversed the Krk hills, we made an impromptu decision to take the local ferry and pass over to a different island. BUT, to our dismay, we discovered that to take the ferry back we have to bike another 15 miles with an 850m elevation gain to another port and, from there, another 40 miles back to where we came from. At this point, we were emotionally shot: tired, hot, hungry, and stuck with this unreasonable plan. There was stress, finger-pointing and even some tears creeping in.

The hills don’t even look bad from this view

### paragraph

Thinking back to it there were some things that we should have handled a bit better and some thoughts we should always keep in mind from now on.

### paragraph

<h3>Agree on a trip purpose</h3> 

As it is when traveling with anyone other than yourself, there are opinions and feelings that need to be taken care of. It is so much easier to agree on activities, time spent on locations etc if you have a clear idea beforehand of what you are both looking for.

### paragraph

Our Rijeka stop was a last minute addition to the trip and we were not sure what to expect or what exactly we wanted to do there. Thus, we were left little time to understand our route or our timeline. If we had better communicated what each of us thought the plan of the day was, a lot of the frustration could have been resolved as we would have left more time for sightseeing or beach time or whatever.

### paragraph

It is easy to start a trip and mid-way through find yourselves frustrated with the details of everyday life. Arguments like “why did we bike all the way up this hill???” or “now what is there to do here” can be avoided if you have agreed on what you are looking for to learn, see, experience on the trip.

### paragraph

<h3>Leave enough time for “down time”</h3>

Traveling is challenging, let's just start with that. To have a full experience for extended traveling you need to take your time! Everyone just wants to see more, do more, learn more, so usually you just rush from one place to another without giving yourself time to take it in. 

### paragraph

We definitely fell victims of wanted to do too much in a day. We did not consider well how long everything would take and by wanting to see more islands we ended up just running out of time and not really having enough time to enjoy any of the islands!

### paragraph

Have you ever come back from a vacation and it takes you a very long time to recall what you did each day? “Down time” gives you the opportunity to reflect of the experiences of everyday and appreciate the details much more. Give yourself time to be “bored” and most importantly give yourself time to get accustomed to a new place to be able to take in all of the unique aspects of the people, the images and the smells. Thats what will be left of it in your memory once you are back.

### paragraph

<h3>Accept the bad days</h3>

And I will repeat for the sake of “sticking”, traveling is challenging. Fun but challenging. And with 100% probability I can tell you that you will have bad days. Days that just go wrong, mistakes that are made and plans that fall apart. Those are the days were frustration builds up. If you have accepted the fact that those things <strong>will</strong> happen, you will be in a better place to deal with the situations and have a better mindset about it. Just enjoy the hardship and learn how to adapt to whatever does not go “as planned” and just laugh it off!

### paragraph

We were not ready to accept that things can go wrong, so when they did we did, we were not ready to say “it’s okay, it’s not a big deal” and move on. Instead we got frustrated that our plan was falling through.
And this takes me to my next point...

### paragraph


<h3>Always be on the same team</h3>
It is easy to blame the other person for whatever goes wrong. Statements such as “why did we take this road?”, “why couldn’t you have thought about this?”, or “now what?” are not productive and do not really make the situation any better. It just puts the other person in a defensive mode and none of you are thinking clearly at that point. Even if you feel very strongly that it IS SOLELY the other person's fault (and as a disclaimer - it rarely is), you are better off to not start the discussion with accusations and blames. Maybe next time try to address the “mistakes” earlier and make your opinion heard sooner.

### paragraph

Remember that you are in this together and you are both responsible for dealing with whatever comes your way. You and your partner feed off each other so the least frustrated you are the better it is for everyone. Always think of the situation as what it is and try together to figure out the best way out - or just enjoy being lost! 

### paragraph

<h3>Talk about what is really wrong</h3>
Sometimes in frustration you tend to blurt out a great deal of things that are not relevant and make up reasons of why you feel that way. JUST STOP, take a deep breath and think of what is really bothering you at this moment. This is not the time to remember that you were annoyed this morning when the bed was not made or 2 days ago he/she ate the last french fry off YOUR plate. Try to remain focused to whatever is going on right now. If you feel that the other person is disregarding your feelings at this particular moment do not group it in with all the times he/she has disregarded your love for french fries. 

### paragraph


<h3>If everything else fails, fight after dinner!</h3>
But seriously, know when you are hungry/tired/sick and understand that 99% of arguments occur when at least one of the above is present. Learn to be able to differentiate when something is really bothering you or you just need a burger! This will eliminate a lot of misfortunes along the way! 

### paragraph

And last but not least without any explanation necessary...

<h3>Just remember who your favorite person is!</h3>
