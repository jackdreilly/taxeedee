First Stop: Lebanon
Beirut
Lebanon

### paragraph
	I am really excited to be writing our first post.
	We have been putting a lot of love into the website design, so much that it is already a month in our trip and we have yet to make a post.
	But this is it!

### paragraph

	Choosing a date to leave your home and move is hard: there's always another event to attend at home, one more project to finish at work, etc... Luckily, our hand was forced by our friends Tala and Marwan's wedding in Beirut.
	The impending date prompted us to buy our one-way tickets for July 2, 2018, give our one-month's notice on our great studio apartment in Berkeley, pack all our stuff, and say goodbye to all our friends with a series of summer backyard BBQ's.
	Jack's band, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rustygroovemusic/">Rusty Groove</a>, even played a goodbye show in our backyard a couple weeks before leaving!

### paragraph

	We have been talking about attending Marwan and Tala's wedding for months and provided a great boost of energy at the start of our journey.
	Tala and Marwan, your wedding was beautiful, your friends fantastic and everyone made sure that we had an unforgettable experience.
	Thank you!

Bmekkine, Lebanon

### paragraph

	Lebanon is a city with an insane amount of history.
	We visited Byblos, one of the oldest cities	in the world, as it has been continuously inhabited for the past 7,000 years!

Byblos, Lebanon

### paragraph

	The city of Beirut was very unique and the civil war it went through in the 70s-90s has definitely left an impact (you could actually see the bullet holes on the sides of the buildings!).
	However, these days Beirut has been known as one of the safest cities, so do not hesitate to visit!
	The architecture and vibe of the city was stunning.

Al-Amin Mosque. Beirut, Lebanon

### paragraph

	There are so many different districts in the city that are massively different from each other ranging from hipster areas (Mar Michael, Gemmayzeh), to the Armenian district and various Christian and Muslim oriented areas throughout the city. This diversity played out in the nightlife as well where parties went all night long from underground bomb selter clubs (thank you Wael for showing us a good time!) to fancy rooftop night clubs!

City Center, Beirut, Lebanon

### paragraph

	Lebanon in general has a Mediterranean and western vibe to it, and the food was absolutely delicious! Olga
	could not get enough <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manakish' target="_blank" >Manouche</a>, which can be eaten for
	breakfast, lunch and dinner!
	Jack's favorite time of day was breakfast where there was a plethora of chickpeas
	recipes, meats and yogurt.
	And of course we could not stay away from the unlimited supply of shawerma (probably one in every corner in the student districts)!
