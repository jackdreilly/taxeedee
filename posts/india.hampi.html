Don't Worry, Be Hampi
Hampi
India

### paragraph
The story of our Hampi visit starts in our Bangalore hostel the night before we were to head to New Delhi.

At this point (not even 2 weeks in our India trip), we were feeling out of place, very uncomfortable (remember that <a href="/post/5bb8d0220be1100001867eb4">leech attack from our previous story</a>?) and fed up with all the dirt, traffic and noise of Indian life. 

### paragraph

The plan was to make an escape at least from the South and make our way to the Himalayas for some serenity. The day before our "escape", we stayed at a hostel in Bangalore and met a friendly, young Indian whose name now escapes us. He sat us down and talked about all the things he loves about India and especially talked so highly of Hampi that he was the reason we decided to give the South another chance and visit this magical place. Thank you, mystical Indian Hostel Boy, for giving our Southern Indian trip another life!

### paragraph

Booking a last-minute ticket from Bangalore to Hampi, we boarded our first ever, 8 hour "sleeper" bus.

"Sleeper" is quoted, as it's possibly the hardest activity to accomplish on board, given the incessant honking, windy turns, bumpy dirt roads, abrupt braking, etc... Even inside the sleeper bus, the passengers are treated to human-sweat-induced humidity and claustrophobic bunk stations, upholstered with antagonizingly musty red velvet reminiscent of the dirtiest of bar booths

Olga's early sleeper bus optimism, to soon give way to sleeper bus torture

### paragraph

For three trying hours, our bus became our pee prison; there were no on-board bathrooms and no evidence of upcoming pit breaks. In a bladder-induced haze, Jack heard what appeared to be the driver alighting, and opportunistically sprung from his top bunk (almost face-planting down the narrow-gage, feet-slicing ladder rungs), and followed the driver out. As it wasn't a sanctioned break, the bus was stopped in the 3rd lane of a busy, 6-lane highway, causing Jack and the ten other passengers following Jack's lead to play Frogger on the Indian Highway in order to end their despair.

### paragraph

Mercifully, the trip came to an end in Hampi. Bleary-eyed, sleep-deprived, and motion sick, our weary travellers made their way to their first Hampi destination. Matanga Hill is famous for its 400 rock-carved-step climb to the top and its magical sunrise.

### paragraph

Feeling fully resuscitated from our night excursion, we descended into the town of Hampi, passing many striking ruins along the way.

### paragraph

<h3>History</h3>
Hampi draws many visitors due to the impressive remains of the once mighty Vijayanagara Empire from the 14th and 15th centuries AD. Attracting merchants from Persia to Portugal, its peak status found it as the second-largest city in the world (behind Beijing) and possibly the richest in all of India. Its doom was met by Muslim sultanates in the 16th century, who reduced much of the Hindu shrines to rubble, while leaving intact a single temple, Virupaksha, due to its Islam-inspired architecture, much to our luck.

Virupaksha Temple

### paragraph

The town of Hampi is properly split into two distinct sectors by the river passing through, with the old Hampi on the south bank, and the funkier "Hippy Island" on the north. We boarded a small river taxi to make it over to the north for our stay, passing many villagers performing daily cleaning on the banks, as well as a religious elephant bath. The "cleanest elephant in the world" is given a daily two hour scrubbing, before being led into the Virupaksha temple for religious display.

Settled in, we headed out on our first adventure, renting a scooter for the day for 2 dollars. Once Jack sorted out which button was "go" and which was "stop", we headed out on the sleepy backroads on Hampi to find some more Hindu temples, running into monkey and cow traffic along the way.

Displaying zero scooting skills, Jack swore off cycles forever and returned the bike. Following tips from fellow travelers, we headed by foot up to "Sunset Point" to take part in the evening jam session. The rock was filled with tourists, local children, and local man, Gali, the musically-inspired rallying point of the evening meeting. Jack joined in with his guitar and jammed with Gali and the children.

The ever-present local kids spotted us up on the rocks, and chatted with us for a bit. Everywhere they go (including Sunset Jam), they carry with them various paraphernalia for sale, such as chai or postcards, and never give up their hustle throughout the entire conversation. Opting out of chai, we instead taught them a few Acroyoga moves for them to practice later.

Our tour guide also gave us our favorite quote of the trip so far. Not uncommonly while walking near nature in India, one will be hit with a potent, unwelcome odor.

Connecting each of the various temples together were 100-meter long open-air markets, which provided the source of wealth and prominence to the old Hampi civilization. Each of these large markets sometimes had a "sister" market nearby, where the merchants would shop for local women.

Hampi was an excellent reminder of the diversity of experiences that India has to offer.

We look forward to covering even more patches of the Indian canvas in our travels, and learn to love both its positive space and negative space.
