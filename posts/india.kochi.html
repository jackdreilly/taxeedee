South India: Fort Kochi
Kerala
India

### paragraph 
We finally landed in India! After talking about it for so long, it’s time to see what it is actually all about!

### paragraph 
Our first stop was Fort Kochi in Kerala (a state in the south west of India). This area is known for its tea plantations and the numerous canals in the backwaters. After a long, good night’s sleep to get rid of the jet-lag, we set out to see the backwaters. Our tour took place on a coconut-rope-outfitted canoe-boat, fitted with 10 plastic lawn chairs for our comfort. The boat was navigated by two "stick"-men, using long bamboo poles navigate the waters: one for propeling the boat by pressing against the river banks and bottoms, and another for steering (they somehow find this strategy more efficient than oars). The waters were very calm and not very deep and we got some amazing views around the canals.

Great views all around

### paragraph 
Right before lunch (rice with a variety of curries, served on a banana leaf), our guide took us to a remote village and demonstrated the rope-making process using the coconut fibers. Jack was selected to test the durability of the final product!

### paragraph 
While in Fort Kochi we also went to see a Kathakali performance. Kathakali is a traditional Indian form of dance, which is characterized by the elaborate costumes, makeup and face-masks that the actors wear. It is a story-telling performance in which actors only use their facial expressions and body language to communicate their role. The dancers are required to master their facial control and acting over 6 years of training, which shows in amount of emotion they can express without speaking. They are accompanied by handheld drums and singing. It was mesmerizing to watch!
