Venice By Bike: Day 1.5
Venice
Italy
<p>
The views of the Venice country-side were an inspiring start to our trip, as the stretch from Venice to Croatia promised to provide a large quantity of country-side, with a dash of cities and civilization added to taste.
</p>
<p>After pushing through some initial rain in the morning on mostly secondary roads, we were on our own on a rather isolated bike path within a couple hours of starting. There was a good variety of scenery, ranging from really neat wooded paths, to swampy lagoon, and tons of corn/soy/rice fields.

After what we had assumed was 55 <i>kilometers</i> on our odometer (more on that later...), we were in our camping spot for the night on an Adriatic beach near Jesolo called Cavallino. Standard procedure for the biking trip promises to be setting up our tent in record time, shoving pasta in our faces, then try and do some writing before our eyes shut from the bike-miles of that day.

  Of note, was the particularly saucy nature of not our food, but of the waiter serving us that night, who quickly reminded us of the differences in customer/server power dynamics between US and other regions.
  Highlights:
  <ul>
    <li>He insisted no less than three times that, despite our pleading, we didn't want a small soda, and that our inadvertant order of a more expensive large soda was not only preferable, but irrevokable, as he had "already pressed the button"</li>
    <li>He ignored us when we had informed him we were ready to order</li>
    <li>And our personal favorite: While Jack was in mid-grab, he removed the complimentary breadsticks from our table and placed them on a different table.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  After having a good laugh at the last one, we enjoyed our carb-buffet, and quickly dozed off to sleep in preparation for the next day.
  Until 2 AM rolled around, and we were treated to an "Vengeful God"-style thunder storm, with literally an average of 1 lightning strike a <i>second</i>, and forceful winds that had us resigned to the fate of being gobbled up in a tornado.
  But of course, we survived to pedal another day, thanks to our trusty REI tent, which kept us nice a cozy.

  Next up: Portogruaro!
