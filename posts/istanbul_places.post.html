What to see in Istanbul
Istanbul
Turkey

### paragraph
	One of the most famous sites to visit in Istanbul is Hagia Sofia. 
	It has a great deal of history associated with it, as it was initially constructed in 537 AD as a Greek Orthodox Church. 
	Its dome is one of the most impressive aspects as it was massive, given the engineering knowledge of the time. 
	When Istanbul was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD, Hagia Sofia was converted into a mosque and islamic features were added to it.
	Notably, most artwork and ornamentation was removed as to stay in line with standard minimal mosque decor.
	Finally in 1935 AD it was converted to a museum and has been open to the public ever since.

Hagia Sofia, Istanbul, Turkey

### paragraph

	As we passed near another Mosque on the Golden Horn, The Blue Mosque, we felt its magnetic pull due to its size and its high positioning atop the city, providing a great overlook on the old city. Make sure to grab a seat at a nearby cafe to take in the views at a relaxing pace.
	We both had to cover up before getting in and there were a lot of volunteer guides inside that give you a (free!) overview of the Muslim faith's customs and the history of the mosque.
	Its really beautiful inside with the red carpet and the enormous chandelier hanging a few feet over our heads. 
	Fun fact: They hang ostrich eggs from the chandelier to keep the spiders away!

Blue Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey

### paragraph

	For a special treat, we took a boat up the Bosporous strait during sunset.
	The views were absolutely stunning on both the European and the Asian side.
	Old palaces, towers and mosques were everywhere to see along the coastline.

Dolmabah√ße Palace, Istanbul, Turkey

### paragraph
	The Grand Bazaar is a must see.
	It's one of the oldest and largest (if not THE largest) indoor markets in the world.
	It's easy to get lost in the narrow corridors, with bright lights, gold plating, and nearly identical shops everywhere.
	We even found ourselves accidentally returning to the same shop 3 times (I'm beginning to think the merchants are hoping we get lost!).
	There are so many colors and smells around you that is overwhelming to shop there but definitely an experience.
