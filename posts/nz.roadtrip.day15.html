NZ roadtrip - Abel Tasman
Wanaka --> Hokitika --> Punakaiki --> Abel Tasman
New Zealand

### paragraph
<h3>Day 15</h3>
After a good nights sleep at yet another free campsite (this time think more parking lot at the side of a highway) and a custom-made Jack Reilly filling breakfast utilizing all of our left overs we started our long drive up to the Glasier territory. The west coast of New Zealand is significantly less populated than the east coast with a lot smaller roads and windy roads making the drives significantly longer than expected. A few hours later, we by-passed Fox Glasier which was closed off to the public due to a landslide that made the access road unaccessible and headed towards Franz Josef Glasier. The walk to the glasier view point is an easy 30 min walk next to the river and you can get as close as 500 m away from the glasier itself. The other option would be to reach deep into your wallet and splurge into an expensive helicopter ride that takes you on top of the glasier. We did not feel like spending a good $600 at this time so we decided to go on a free 17 km hike the next day for a better view of the glacier.

### paragraph
On the way back we stopped at a local grocery store to restock on supplies and were much again amused by the crazy expensive prices of New Zealands produce. Even at the cheapest warehouse-style store "Pack N Save" (similar to Costco) the prices we witnessed were extravagant. We would need to spend around 4 NZ$ on a single eggplant or even worse something like 7 NZ$ for a very much medium-sized colliflower. As we later would find out, NZ does not provide an government subsidies to farmers and there is not really a large farm kind of production so the prices you have to pay are more or less accounting for the farmers risks of "not selling" on top of the operational and transportation costs. Seasonality of produce also affects the vegetable prices and we found out the only way to get reasonably priced vegetables in NZ is the local farmer markets. Poor timing on our part to try to eat a more vegetarian diet!

### paragraph
<h3>Day 16</h3>
Bright and not-so-early we started our ascent in the Alex Knob trail to an elevation of 3600 feet (~1000 m) to get up close to the Franz Josef Glasier. The hike is a steady incline for about 3 hours to the top so we could easily keep a good conversation going while progressing towards the top. During the hike we had the pleasure to meet Gabriel, a very friendly Italian on his work-holiday visa, that checked all the items on our Italian sterotype list. He was hilarious, passionate about pizza and moved his hands all around the place when trying to explain something. In short we had a blast listening to all his stories and got scolded multiple times for thinking about eating pizza in NZ... "Pizza in New Zealand no, not good, you wait until you go to Italia and then get the real pizza in Napoli!".

### paragraph
Arriving at the top, we were pondering where the glacier was as we were once again boxed in by the clouds and could not see further than 50 m ahead... To our amazement though, a few minutes later and while we were devouring our sandwiches the clouds made an impressive reavealing of the glacier opening up just enough for us to have the perfect sunny view of the glacier. We managed to take a few quick photos before the clouds came rolling in again and started feeling a few drops of rain coming down... Later that evening we had the great pleasure to meet up with our new French friends, Marie and Elliot, once more as they made the trip up to come meet us at our campsite. We went out to dinner to celebrate the reunion and enjoyed a prepared meal with them.

<h3>Day 17</h3>
For our last few days on the road we decided to finish the entire loop of the South island and head all the way up to the Golden Bay and spend a few days on the beautiful Abel Tasman trail. To split up the long drive we made a couple of pit stops along the way and spent a day in Hokitika where we had our first fish 'n' chips at a local roadside restaurant. The weather was cold and rainy so we decided to give the local library a visit and spend the afternoon chilling and reading. That evening we set up an impromtu AcroYoga beginners class at our campsite with a few campers that were interested to learn how to be up-side-down!

<h3>Day 18</h3>
As the previous day was kind of lazy for our standards before we hit the road again to drive towards the north we followed some of our fellow campers to visit the Hokitika Gorge. It was a short walk to the river and covered with sandflies but that did not deter Jack of jumping in the cold waters!

The next pit stop was at Punakaiki Rocks where we spent a good 2 hours just watching water get splashed everywhere through the pancake rocks! It was majestic just to watch the force of the water come in and all the various shapes and forms it got while crushing on the rocks.

<h3>Day 20</h3>
Bright and early we arrived at the trailhead for Abel Tasman. It is supposed to be one of the most beautiful and most popular treks of the South island and is part of the "Great Walks" of New Zealand. That is mostly to say that it is just an excuse to make the campgrounds and hikes overpriced as we did not find the "Great Walks" to be any more "Great" that all the other beautiful treks that we did. Anyhow we got really lucky and the entire trail was empty when we were there, even the campgrounds that we stayed at were barely attended by humans but very well attended by the Weka!

Did someone say "WEKA"? 

### paragraph
The Abel Tasman trek is stunning with a series of beautiful beaches waiting for you ar every corner of the trek. One of the most fun things of the trek was that you had to time your walking to reach the beaches at the low tide of the day. That would still mean that you would have to get knee deep into the water but at least you would avoid the swimming part! We learned that there are <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/geoscience/why-are-there-two-tides-day"> 2 low tides each day</a>, followed by 2 high tides! There were a lot of late night discussions on us trying to put our entire physics knowledge down to justify that second tide and without any internet connection to provide us with the "truth" I am sure we made up a lot of "facts"!

<h3>Day 21</h3>
The last day of the trek involves a speedboat ride back to the beginning of the trek where trusted "Vinnie" was waiting for our return. As the depth of the "port" is not deep enough for the boats to reach the land, especially during low tides, a tractor has to come into the water, about 50-100 m from the shore, and tag the boat all the way out of the water while all the passengers are still inside the boat! It is funny to see all the tractors scattered around in the water waiting for speedboats to arrive!

<h3>Day 24</h3>
And like that the roadtrip came to an end... We returned "Vinnie" to Wicked Campers and flew to Wellington. We 're planning to spent a few weeks there, livin' the city life and exploring the urban New Zealand. We have found another Workaway project, this time living with a lovely Kiwi family that is willing to take us in and give us chores to do around the house. They have a little terror living with them, Mockey, a little cavoodle, that we will help take care of and give lots of love to.
