Adriatic By Bike: Day 2
Portogruaro
Italy

### paragraph

We decided to travel by bike so we need to be tough, right? Well Day 2 is making sure that we can handle all the weather elements... 

### paragraph

After successfully surviving the first night in our tent in Cavallino with all the thunder, lightnings and winds that simulated tornados (!) we were on the road again. It was raining and significantly colder than the day before and unfortunately we had a head wind which made it impossible to keep our 12m/h pace Jack has set on us (realistically more like 10m/h for Olga, but Jack never has to know!).

### paragraph
A couple of hours of biking was all we could handle before, starved, wet and cold, we stopped at yet another pizzeria (always a good mood booster). The prosciutto pizza we got was THE best thing we had ever tried and while we shoved our faces in it, the weather decided to do us a solid and toned it down quite a bit.

Weathering the storm, Italia style

### paragraph
With our energy restored and our clothes drying up quickly, we headed to the coastal town of Caorle for a nice gelato topper to our pizza lunch.

All the colors of the wind

### paragraph

Seeing light at the end of the tunnel otherwise known as "Day 2", we made some good progress and biked the next 30ish km's to Portogruaro. What a treat that place was! Quaint and with a very unique atmosphere, it is not without reason named “little Venice”. The river that goes through it is the main route of transportation (even now it is still used by locals with a river-front location), with all the houses' main facade facing that way and not towards the street!

### paragraph

But the real treat was the friends we made. While looking for a place to stay and asking about a campsite we got responses like:
“yes, yes there is one just 20 km away.” (Translation: bike for another 1.5h and you're there!) At that point Olga was desperate and decided to test our chances with the locals by asking a nice looking lady for recommendations for a cheap hotel or somewhere we could pitch our tent.
We attempted italian-english exchange of words along the lines of “hotel, cheap, posto dormitore, gardenio...”.
The result was totally unexpected and proved to us once more that truly kind people still exist in this world. After making a few phone-calls she said:
“Sure, my husband will come and pick you up and you can sleep in our art studio and here are the keys to our house if you need to use the bathroom.” She did not think twice about offering us their house keys! Just wow!

### paragraph

Renzo, Elvira and their son Ermanno were so lovely. They showed us around their charming town, pointing out the historical aspects of their city. Along the way, Renzo ran into and joked with no fewer than 30 acquaintances, leading Olga to nickname him "The Mayor". He even knew the barista in the 20-km adjacent town he accompanied us to!

Our new friends, Renzo and Elvira

### paragraph

After a good night's rest, we joined them for breakfast in their apartment. What a lovely home. They also gave us the one half of a rock that will be whole again when we meet them in the future (sorry Ermanno one less rock in your collection!)
