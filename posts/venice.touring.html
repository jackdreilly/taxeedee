History in Venice

Let me tell you a story...

### paragraph

In 400 A.D. Venice, the political situation was not as we know it today. After the collapse of the Roman empire, multiple conquerors reached the area and demanded a piece of the land. In that era of turmoil the population that resided in the area that today we call Veneto was made to flee for their lives and become refugees. The local populations were just trying to find a land where they could reside peacefully. They decided to move to the islands of Venice mostly to be away from the mainland and hidden away from the invaders.

### paragraph

 The many islands of Venice were not really a welcoming place to settle, as the land consisted mostly marshlands, with soft soils and lagoons. During high tides most of the land would be covered by water, eliminating the available land. The first settlers did not decide to move there by choice but rather out of necessity, as refugees of war.

### paragraph

Even though the land was not ideal, the fist settlers put a lot of love into their new home. In order to make it habitable, they had to reinforce it and elevate it out of the water. The strategy they went for was to build structures similar to swimming pools, pump all the water out and refill it with soils brought over from the mainland.

### paragraph

Slowly, Venice became a real city. A folk explanation for the origin of the name of "Venice", is that it derived from the Latin verb "venire" (to come). The story goes that the first settlers would go to the mainland to get supplies and would find people looking for a peaceful place to reside. The early Venetians would then invite them over to their hidden island. When the newcomers would arrive, they would cry "veni etiam", which translates to "Yet, I have come!". For those looking for historical accuracy, check Wikipedia :)

### paragraph

As the Venetian land was not really prosperous for agriculture, the local people found a way to make their income by trading supplies by sea. They focused their attention towards the rich markets of the East, specifically Levantine and Constantinople. They slowly became great sailors and brilliant boat-makers. The profits from trade made Venice a powerful naval city and, due to their strategic location, they controlled most of the trade-routes in the Mediterranean sea. Venice florished as a trading center during those times. Later on, they also participated in the Crusades, by agreeing to transport the Crusaders to the Holy Land. As the Crusaders were unable to pay their dues towards Venice, they were convinced to sail to Constantinople and raid it. The Venetians and the Crusaders managed to capture Constantinople in 1204 and looted it entirely.

### paragraph

A great risk for the Venetians along with the rest of the other populations at the time was that deadly diseases were a real threat. From prior run-ins with plague, they understood the risks of traveling to far away lands and mixing with the local populations. The Venetians had a very successful system in place to protect their city. When the sailors would return from a long journey, they would have to be held for 40 days on an isolated island off the coast of Venice. This prevented the diseases from spreading to the local population. By the way, the word that we are using today for this process, "quarantine", is actually derived from the Italian word for 40 ("quaranta") because the sailors had to be isolated for 40 days.

### paragraph

As long as this system was in place Venice became very profitable. Their greediness, however, ended up being their “Achilles heel” as they realized that by having a ship docked for 40 days did not help their profits. The 40-day isolation system slowly got decreased to 30, 20 and finally 10 days. 10 days was not quite long enough though and, in 1630, Venice got hit hard by the deadly bubonic plague. At that time Venice’s population was decreased by 40% and marked the beginning of the end to a long, prosperous era. During the 17th century, Venice gradually lost power and influence.

### paragraph

We had a blast exploring this beautiful city. The love that the Venetians put in while building it is apparent, particularly from the above photos of our visit. We enjoyed getting lost at the narrow streets as it is realistically impossible to find your way around in Venice. There are small bridges everywhere connecting the numerous small islands and no 2 streets are parallel with each other, or straight for that matter. Your sense of direction is completely lost in Venice which gives it part of the charm while exploring around.

### paragraph

The fact that Venice was mainly built by sailors, is illustrated from the major statues throughout the city that are actually built in a way that they rotate to point to the direction of the wind. Just brilliant...
