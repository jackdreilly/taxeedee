Acro Yoga Retreat
Gajana
Croatia

### paragraph

With sore wrists, filled brains, and a renewed passion, we can report our completion of the week-long <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/958753607600416/">AcroVenture Retreat</a> in Istria, Croatia.

### paragraph

We have been learning acro-yogo for the last year or so, as all our friends whom we've annoyed with our mini-demos at parks already know. While we've definitely progressed in that timespan, we've felt discouraged at times by a number of plateaus. Our coaching has mostly been limited to (save for some great lessons from Olga's sister, Ioanna) copying moves from instagram and youtube, and lots and lots of falling. Thus, when the opportunity arose to learn from the best of the best for a full week, we obviously jumped at the opportunity.

### paragraph

A bit of background into how we stumbled upon this retreat: In 2013, (that long ago???) I (Jack) went to Zurich, Switzerland for a summer internship with Google, and befriended a fellow intern, Adrien, while sharing an apartment with him for the summer. We quickly bonded over many weekend trips, late nights at work, and some Springsteen jam sessions...

### paragraph

Looking for an opportunity to meet up with Adrien during our time in Europe, I reached out in August to see his summer plans. He then proposed we meet up in Croatia in September, as he was attending an Acroyoga workshop then.  As luck would have it, our cyclying tour finished at the exact location of the workshop and nearly the same time as our planned finish. It was too good of a match to pass up, and Olga and I quickly booked the retreat, and looked forward to a week of catching up with Adrien and his girlfriend Florence, and working on our acro skills.

### paragraph

The retreat took place near Rovinj at an isolated, scenic villa. We arrived in Rovinj the day before the retreat. We set up our tent at 11 PM, plopped to bed, woke up, and caught some sun before heading to the retreat villa.

### paragraph

The large estate permitted many good spots for us to set our tent down, as our home for the week. We had a great spot next to the daily events, allowing us to sleep in until we could see the warm-up yoga moves from our sleeping bags.

Warming up before lessons in "The Tent"

### paragraph

While our first day did not feature any acro-yoga, we did have our first encounter with the amazing meals prepared for us by the hippy kitchen crew, who were all tightly integrated with the entire retreat community, making the meals all the more enjoyable.

As advertised before our arrival, the food for the entire week would be largely vegan, and wholly vegetarian. Our previous vegetarian "record" was likely no longer than a day and a half, but any concern of missing meat disappeared that first night, and we hardly gave another thought to the dietary restrictions for the rest of the retreat.

### paragraph

The core workouts from the week introduced us to many new acro-yoga concepts:

<ul>
  <li>Icarian "pops", where the base sends the flyer into the air, creating a brief full disconnection.</li>
  <li>Whips, where momentum is used to "whip" the flyer quickly from one position to another, oftentimes against the will of gravity.</li>
  <li>Montreal flows, a form of acro-yoga which encourages creativity, improvisation, and continually separation of the base and flyer into different ground poses,</li>
</ul>

as well as other core acro-yoga exercises such as individual handstands and "hand-to-hand" holds.

### paragraph

In addition to the twice-daily core acro-yoga lessons, we also took in daily courses of yoga (punishing, but a wonderful body wake-up in the morning) and a course called "contact improv", where we learned to move our bodies in creative and often unintuitive manners. The improv movement skills definitely come in handy for Olga when I make her fall from an array of different acro pose failures...

### paragraph

Each evening also featured a unique wind-down event, including bonfire, thai massage, and sound-based spiritual adventures. A couple of truly magical experiences of note:
<ul>
  <li>A group of 25 women single a single, sustained note for about 5 minutes. Incredible sensations of swirling, layered overtones and harmony were swept over the 7 men in the middle of the circle receiving the sound from the outer circle of women. Sadly, the men's response chant couldn't match the intensity of the women's, maybe due to the small numbers or men's inability to let go and just sing, damnit...</li>
  <li>The "Exstatic Dance" on the closing night, where for 30 minutes, the entire retreat danced to live, tribal-style music with such fervor that it approached religion.</li>
</ul>

### paragraph

Despite all the wonderful progress we made during the week and the extracurriculars mentioned, I would still rank as the highlight of the retreat all the wonderful and passionate new people we met, and the extended time with the friends we already have (lookin at you Adrien and Florence!). From the charisma and sincerity exuded from the teachers dedicating their lives to body movement, to the stories of the lives of the course's students giving us envy, Olga and I were reminded how important it is to surround ourselves with such motivating, inspiring, positive, uplifting people.

### paragraph

The week gave us an increased clarity in exactly what we're searching for in our travels. It's clear we wish to discover more fully the diversity of human kindness, human nature, and human connections in all parts of the world. This last week in Rovinj certainly set the bar for the types of connections we hope to make in our subsequent adventures.
