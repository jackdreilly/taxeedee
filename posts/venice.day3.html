Adriatic By Bike: Day 3
Aquileia
Italy
<p>
  The weather looks magnificent this morning! Sunny and warm it is everything we could have wished for. With our energy high after the bread, honey and jam at Elvira and Renzoâ€™s place we are up to a good start.
</p>
<p>
  I did not mention yesterday that Renzo is a hardcore ultra marathoner, so he decided to do his morning bike stroll with us! He was our trusted guide for the first 15 km of the day and showed us around the nice countryside. We also got italian cappuccinos in Latisana.

  After our goodbyes we biked a bit more for a pit stop in Marano Lagunare and then off to Palmanova. Palmanova was not initally part of the trip but Renzo spoke so highly of it we had to do the detour to see it. It was amazing! It is a city in the shape of a perfect nonagon (this means that it has nine corners if you look from the sky) and that shape is maintained throughout the city with a bunch of ring roads connecting it. It is really unique and, yes, they have tasty gelato that we could not skip on!

  We decided to spend the night in Aquileia. Aquileia is an old roman town with lots of ruins and places to visit. Our personal favorite was the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta. It is dated back to the 4th century and its architecture is really amazing. The most amazing characteristic is its mosaic floor, which is very well maintained and trully stunning. The mosaic contains such highlights as:
  <ul>
    <li>A tortoise (bad) battling a rooster (good).</li>
    <li>A beefcake, clean-shaven Jesus, doing his best impression of Russell Crowe in Gladiator</li>
    <li>Lochness Monster fishing</li>
  </ul>
